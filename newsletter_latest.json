My name is Theresa Hinz, and I am the Executive Director of Policy and Risk Response at OSFI. I'm speaking from Ottawa, on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe people. Thank you for joining us for OSFI's first Quarterly Release Day of 2026 for this technical briefing. This quarter, we are announcing: a six-month consultation on credit risk management ; a nine-month consultation on senior leader accountability ; and the final Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline for 2026; And we are providing updates on: the new Guide to Administrative Monetary Penalties , and continuation of loan-to-income limits on uninsured mortgage portfolios . Credit Risk Management consultation Today, our expectations on credit risk are spread across multiple guidance documents. As such, we are consolidating our credit risk expectations into one principles-based Credit Risk Management Guideline . Today's consultative document launches the first phase of that work. The six-month consultation ensures ample time for industry feedback on overarching principles and key content areas, and we will hold future consultations on the text of the draft guideline in due time. Senior Leader Accountability consultation We are also launching a consultation on senior leader accountability . The regime we are proposing is principles-based and outcomes-focused, allowing institutions to tailor frameworks to their size and complexity while reinforcing strong governance. The extended consultation period reflects OSFI's decision to sequence this work carefully and ensures that it does not overlap with our broader consultation on our corporate governance expectations. And now the final LAR Guideline . The final LAR Guideline for 2026 reflects feedback from last year's consultation and improves the consistency of liquidity risk measurement. The LAR Guideline 2026 clarifies which deposits qualify as retail funding, updates the treatment of partnership deposits and structured notes, and simplifies the definition of retail rate-sensitive deposits. This provides greater certainty for institutions and strengthens OSFI's liquidity monitoring. The guideline takes effect May 1, 2026. Status updates I have a number of other status updates I would also like to speak to you about today. First, OSFI is releasing a Guide to Administrative Monetary Penalties . The guide clarifies how penalties are assessed and applied by OSFI. Second, following the loan-to-income (LTI) limits pilot, OSFI has determined that they lessen the build‑up of highly levered residential mortgage borrowers, which in turn reduces systemic risk. Therefore, LTI limits will remain in place. At this time, existing debt service expectations in Guideline B-20 will continue to complement LTI limits. Finally, OSFI is delaying certain initiatives to cadence our policy release that pose less immediate risk, including: consultations on revised Guideline B-12 on interest rate risk management; consulting on the disclosure expectation for financed emissions related to off-balance sheet assets under management under Guideline B-15, which will be revisited in due course. OSFI also deferred the implementation to a future date. The initiatives announced today build on our Annual and Semi-Annual Risk Outlooks and demonstrate our commitment to smart, forward-looking oversight. Thank you for joining us today. I will now turn it over to Christina to moderate the Q&A.",

      "content": "OSFI’s Quarterly Release: continuing to advance smart, well-calibrated risk-taking News release - Ottawa - January 29, 2026 Today, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) had its first Quarterly Release of 2026. As part of this release, OSFI has finalized new liquidity guidance and is launching consultations on credit risk management as well as accountability for boards and senior leaders. This Quarterly Release highlights how OSFI's focused policy efforts and smart oversight are engaging industry on risk issues that are the most critical and have greatest impact. Concentrating resources where they matter most ensures institutions can adapt and grow while preserving confidence and stability. Specific details include: OSFI is consolidating existing credit risk management guidance for mortgage lending, commercial real estate, and corporate lending into a single, principle-based guideline. A six-month consultation will seek feedback on overarching principles and key content areas. The resulting Credit Risk Management Guideline will align with international best practices and improve regulatory and supervisory efficiency, while reducing complexity and compliance burden for institutions. OSFI will start a nine-month consultation focused on the issues of governance and accountability for boards and senior leaders . Governance and accountability risks can weaken financial institution resilience — when these risks materialize, they often appear as a systemic issue bypassing an institution's early warning system. Strong governance and accountability help institutions stay resilient, manage risk, and maintain public trust. OSFI refined the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline for 2026 to improve consistency in liquidity risk measurement and support institutions' long-term strategic planning. OSFI also provided additional updates: The development of a new guide to its administrative monetary penalties . Following its pilot, OSFI has determined that loan-to-income (LTI) limits lessen the build‑up of highly leveraged residential mortgage borrowers, which in turn reduces systemic risk. Therefore, LTI limits will remain in place. At this time, existing debt service expectations in Guideline B-20 will continue to complement LTI limits. Quote OSFI's approach to regulatory oversight is principles-based, proportionate, and focused on the risks that matter most. Through this release, OSFI aims to improve prudential clarity without over-burdening institutions or compromising the resilience of Canada's financial system. OSFI's continued approach to smart oversight will help Canadian institutions thrive during this period of uncertainty. Quick facts On February 12, 2026, OSFI will hold a virtual Industry Day on topics listed above and provide the opportunity to ask questions. Stakeholders are invited to register for Industry Day . This release builds on priorities identified in OSFI's Annual and Semi-Annual Risk Outlook, which outline the most significant risks facing Canada's financial system. On January 8, 2026, OSFI announced that the planned public consultation on Guideline B-15's disclosure expectation for financed emissions related to off-balance sheet assets under management was paused. Implementation is deferred to a future date, as reflected in Annex 2-2 of Guideline B-15. Since August 2024, OSFI streamlined how it releases guidance through its Quarterly Releases followed two weeks later by Industry Day. This ensures continued transparency as well as predictability.

      "content": "Backgrounder: Final Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline (2026) Backgrounder - January 29, 2026 Overview The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) published the final Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline for 2026. The guideline reflects feedback from a 60‑day public consultation that ended in July 2025. The LAR Guideline sets out how OSFI monitors whether financial institutions can meet their obligations in cash or with assets that can be quickly converted to cash. It helps ensure federally regulated banks, bank holding companies, and trust and loan companies can handle deposit withdrawals and meet payment and settlement obligations even in periods of stress. The final guideline clarifies which deposits can be classified as retail funding and qualify for favourable liquidity treatment. Partnership deposits are separated into smaller groups based on whether they are insured, whether they are in a transactional account, and whether they are part of an established relationship between the retail client and non-bank financial intermediary (NBFI). The two proposed categories of retail structured notes are combined into one, with liquidity treatment aligned with term deposits directly managed by an unaffiliated third party. The guideline also clarifies how to measure the maturity of structured notes with autocallable features and when contingent funding obligations should apply. Finally, it simplifies the definition of retail rate‑sensitive deposits. Why it’s important Liquidity is one of the biggest risks facing deposit-taking institutions as losses can occur when there is insufficient liquidity to handle a stress event. The final LAR Guideline (2026) reflects the innovation and evolution of financial markets while enhancing the financial resilience and stability of federally regulated deposit-taking institutions. The final LAR Guideline (2026) sharpens deposit-taking institutions’ focus on one of the most important risks affecting their safety and soundness while considering regulatory burden and respecting the need for institutions to compete and take reasonable risks. Enhancements to OSFI’s liquidity regime continue to meet international standards agreed upon by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Next steps OSFI published the final LAR Guideline (2026) on January 29, 2026, and it will come into effect on May 1, 2026. Contacts OSFI – Media Relations Media-Medias@osfi-bsif.gc.ca 343-550-9373",

      "content": "Backgrounder: Consultative document on Senior Leader Accountability Backgrounder - January 29, 2026 Overview The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) is issuing a consultative document on senior leader accountability . This nine-month consultation focuses on a principles-based regime to modernize suitability and accountability standards for senior leaders of federally regulated financial institutions. This regime is a subset of OSFI’s broader corporate governance work, but one of the areas OSFI considers most critical. Why it’s important Canada’s financial services are growing more complex amid a more uncertain risk environment. As the landscape changes, governance standards, capabilities and practices must keep pace to address new challenges and skill needs. Strong senior leader accountability helps institutions stay resilient, manage risk and maintain public trust. Weak suitability and accountability can pose serious non‑financial risks. Leaders who are unsuitable or unaccountable can weaken governance, harm public trust in their institutions, and affect the broader economy and financial system. To gather feedback on its proposed senior leader accountability regime, OSFI is engaging early and often with a broad range of stakeholders. The goal is to ensure the regime is practical, effective, and aligned with industry realities and international practices. OSFI’s approach is principles‑based and focused on outcomes rather than prescriptive rules. This allows institutions to tailor their frameworks to their size and complexity, reinforce good practices, and build on the governance and controls they already have in place. The extended consultation period gives institutions time to provide input, while continuing their day‑to‑day operations. The timeline also reflects OSFI’s decision to postpone consultation on the draft Corporate Governance and Accountability Guideline. Next steps The consultation period ends on October 31, 2026. Stakeholders are invited to send their feedback to pds-epn@osfi-bsif.gc.ca . The feedback will help inform OSFI’s final guidance.

      "content": "Backgrounder: Consultative document on Credit Risk Management Backgrounder - January 29, 2026 Overview The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) is developing a comprehensive Credit Risk Management (CRM) Guideline to strengthen how institutions manage credit risk. The guideline will consolidate and streamline existing regulatory expectations and incorporate international best practices on credit risk. By clarifying its expectations in a single guideline, OSFI aims to enhance regulatory and supervisory efficiency. The guideline will also support agile responses to evolving areas of risk, including non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) and counterparty credit risk. Why it’s important Credit risk is a fundamental risk for financial institutions, and mortgage and commercial lending consistently rank among the top risks in OSFI’s Annual Risk Outlook. Today, OSFI’s expectations for sound credit risk management are spread across multiple guidelines, notices, advisories, and letters. Bringing these expectations together in a single, clear guideline will reduce compliance burden, close regulatory gaps, and make it easier for institutions to interpret and apply OSFI’s guidance. Next steps OSFI will use a phased approach to consultation on the draft CRM Guideline. OSFI is seeking input on the consultation document by July 29, 2026. After this initial phase, OSFI plans to release draft chapters on: the overarching principles aligned with international standards wholesale credit risk management covering loans to institutions, corporates, partnerships, proprietorships and commercial real estate NBFI risk management informed by recommendations from the Financial Stability Board and counterparty credit risk practices from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision real estate secured lending, including consolidated expectations currently in Guideline B‑20: Residential mortgage underwriting practices and procedures, and related advisories, notices and letters Contacts OSFI – Media Relations Media-Medias@osfi-bsif.gc.ca 343-550-9373",

Torrell Glinton Facebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save The Bahamas welcomed a record-breaking 12.5 million visitors in 2025, smashing 2024’s record and blowing past pre-pandemic 2019 figures by more than 72 percent, Minister of Tourism, Investments and Aviation Chester Cooper said yesterday. But while sea arrivals shot up by 14 percent last year, air arrivals had a slight drop of 1.6 percent compared to 2024 figures. Cooper, who is also deputy prime minister, touted the statistics as good news for The Bahamas, revealing visitor arrivals grew 11.4 percent year over year. “I am pleased to note that this now signals record-level performances for the third consecutive year,” he said in the House of Assembly. “Whilst some might seek to downplay the impact of these arrivals, they represent jobs and salaries, shifts filled, inventory purchased, tours booked, taxis running, restaurants busy, marinas active, straw vendors selling, small hotels and Airbnb hosts earning, and Bahamian families feeling the difference across islands.” Sea arrivals exceeded 10.6 million visitors, representing a 14 percent increase year over year and nearly double 2019 levels, Cooper said. He said success in this area reflects years of relationship-building with cruise partners, an improved product, better port operations, and new infrastructure. Cooper said air arrivals were “resilient” with nearly 1.7 million foreign air visitors last year, although there was a slight decline (1.6 percent) compared to 2024’s figures. “We note late-year positive momentum included year-over-year growth in the month December of 1.1 percent, notwithstanding weather constraints, global aviation constraints and geopolitical issues,” he said. He said stopover figures in 2025 remained above 2019 levels: 1,821,076 compared to 1,806,908. Cooper said Grand Bahama’s tourism sector has seen a rebound, adding that for the first time in more than 22 years that island’s arrivals have eclipsed one million, reaching 1.1 million through December 2025. He said air arrivals to Grand Bahama were up 20 percent in 2025 compared to 2024 and up more than 30 percent compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Sea arrivals “exploded” in Grand Bahama with a more than 90 percent increase in 2025 compared to 2024 and a more than 100 percent increase over pre-pandemic arrivals in 2019, Cooper said. “Grand Bahama is now among the fastest growing tourism destinations in The Bahamas, and certainly one of the strongest rebound stories in the wider region, and the economic impact is undeniable,” Cooper said. Abaco delivered a “standout performance” last year, recording its highest total visitor arrivals on record at just south of 520,000 visitors in 2025, driven by record-breaking air and sea arrivals, Cooper said. Abaco’s air arrivals grew by 5.2 percent, making it the second-fastest growing destination by air arrivals, he said. Both Abaco and Grand Bahama were devastated by Hurricane Dorian, a monster storm, in 2019. Officials have seen an uptick in Canadian visitors to The Bahamas. Cooper said data from the Ministry of Tourism shows that by December 2025, stopover arrivals from Canada outperformed 2024 and surpassed 2019. This was achieved with the launch of flights by Porter Airlines and increased airlift by WestJet and Air Canada. Canada accounted for seven percent of stopover visits in 2025, and tourism officials expect this trend to continue. During his speech, Cooper took a swipe at people he said are quietly rooting for the tourism product to fail in order to boost their political fortunes. “The idea that national success should be treated as a political inconvenience is not patriotism,” he said. “This record performance in tourism is not a small feat. It reflects sustained global demand, a strong brand and a tourism strategy delivering tangible economic impact across the country.” Despite the industry’s success last year, Cooper acknowledged ongoing challenges in the sector. Weather disruptions, hurricanes, unforeseen aviation constraints and geopolitical issues affected travel in 2025, he said. “Our overall stopover growth continues to be constrained by limited room inventory,” Cooper said, adding that the Tourism Development Corporation is focused on supporting grants for short-term vacation rentals as new tourist investments come on stream over the medium- to long-term. “That is why our focus now is on sustaining growth responsibly, improving quality, strengthening infrastructure, and ensuring that benefits are felt more widely, not just in total arrivals but in household opportunity,” he said. The Ministry of Tourism plans to continue to grow stopover and tourist spending by increasing airlift, improving the pro",

The 48-year-old, identified in court as OG, was sentenced to 27 years’ imprisonment in March 2024 after a jury unanimously convicted him of incest. The convict, who has maintained his innocence, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. However, his legal challenge was beset by multiple adjournments due to missing transcripts. Justice of Appeal Gregory Smith set an appeal hearing date of May 5 yesterday after the prosecutor Shaneka Carey and the convict’s lawyer, Craig Butler, confirmed they had received the transcripts. According to the evidence, which was accepted by the jury, the man began molesting his 13-year-old daughter soon after her mother, his wife, died in 2013. He introduced the child to porn and taught her to masturbate before he began sexually abusing her. The daughter said that when she got older, her father would allow her to go on dates if she had sex with him first, and that he would perform intimate searches and bathe her when she returned home. He also introduced her to an escort service, where she had sex with an older man. The abuse continued until 2020 when his daughter moved out of the house at age 21 after her younger sister made a complaint to the police.

The alliance, which took effect in late July, but not widely disclosed, was designed primarily to boost reservations and customer reach. “Guests are now able to get points, and so on,” Wynter said, referring to Best Western’s loyalty programme. The affiliation connects Terra Nova to one of the world’s largest hotel networks, expanding its distribution capabilities without heavy capital investments.

Independent hotels across the region are increasingly turning to such arrangements, gaining access to centralised reservation systems and loyalty programmes without undertaking costly renovations or relinquishing operational autonomy. To meet Best Western’s brand identity and service benchmarks, Terra Nova is working with Hotel Equities, a US-based hospitality management and development firm that provides training and operational support. “They are consultants,” she said. “They do the training because they work alongside Best Western.” Hotel Equities supports nearly 1,000 hotel rooms across nine Caribbean and Latin American markets, including Curaçao, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Trinidad & Tobago, according to its website.

The city hotels cater primarily to corporate travellers and upscale tourists rather than the beach resort clientele that dominates Jamaica’s north coast. Built in 1924 as a private mansion and converted to a hotel in the 1950s, Terra Nova’s ‘41 suites’ occupy a historic niche in Kingston’s lodging landscape. Since the start of the pandemic, the Hussey family embarked on an ambitious expansion plan. In 2021, the family launched The Residences at Terra Nova, a $7-billion, high-rise development adjacent to the hotel. Construction halted a year later, despite reports that roughly half the units had attracted bankable offers. The family blamed adverse market conditions, which reportedly made continued operation as hotel units more financially viable than residential sales. The suspension came as Jamaica’s short-term rental market experienced rapid growth while borrowing costs surged. Kingston’s short-term rental listings jumped 40 per cent between 2022 and 2023, climbing from 2,000 to 2,820 properties, according to AirDNA, which aggregates data from Airbnb and Vrbo.

John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, told investors gathered in Kingston on Tuesday that “reglobalisation” – the realignment of trade relationships – presents opportunities for countries near the US as businesses diversify away from politically sensitive regions. “Reglobalisation is very simply likely to be exceptionally beneficial for the emerging markets, especially those that are neighbours of the US in the southern hemisphere,” Stoltzfus said at the Jamaica Stock Exchange Investments and Capital Markets Conference. “It would seem to us that countries like Jamaica, especially well positioned as you are philosophically, and with an encouragement of capitalism and entrepreneurism, we think this is just a terrific opportunity.” He was speaking on the topic ‘Innovative Financial Products Driving Emerging Market Growth ’ at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel in New Kingston on January 21. The remarks came one day after President Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum, expressing his expansionary policy of acquiring the nation of Greenland. Denmark, the protectorate of the country, continues to reject Trump’s posturing. It follows the US capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, arising from a military invasion. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters. Stoltzfus, who has four decades of experience trading global markets, distinguished between deglobalisation – a retreat from interconnected trade – and reglobalisation, which he described as a restructuring of partnerships based on geopolitical alignment rather than cost alone. He didn’t explicitly mention US-China tensions or tariff barriers driving the shift. He credited technology with expanding both the speed of information and range of investment products available to retail investors. Stoltzfus praised Jamaica’s regulatory framework and entrepreneurial culture as advantages in attracting capital. “I do believe that the fundamentals remain remarkably good in the US and in different countries around the world, including this one,” he said, citing “proper regulation and support of the capital markets” and recognition that “entrepreneurism is very much alive”. luke.douglas@gleanerjm.com «The business behind an autistic Barbie doll Tank-Weld enters solar distribution market » View the discussion thread.",

      "content": "News DASHAN HENDRICKS Business Content Manager hendricksd@jamaicaobserver.com January 30, 2026 Wage pressures strain budget Fiscal watchdog sounds alarm as Jamaica plans post-hurricane rebuild Jamaica’s fiscal watchdog has warned that rising public sector wage pressures are already straining the budget, complicating the Government’s ability to finance post-hurricane reconstruction. The Independent Fiscal Commission (IFC) said compensation costs exceeded budgeted levels in the first half of the fiscal year and could climb further as unsettled wage negotiations conclude, adding pressure to public finances weakened by the impact of Hurricane Melissa, which slammed into the island on October 28 last year. The warning comes as the Government prepares to outline its post-hurricane reconstruction financing plans, with spending needs expected to rise sharply in the months ahead. “Unsettled public sector wage negotiations could lead to higher-than-budgeted wages and salaries expenditure, thus posing a significant fiscal risk,” the commission said in its January assessment tabled in Parliament on Tuesday. From April to September, compensation of employees totalled $255.1 billion, overshooting the original budget by $3.2 billion, or 1.3 per cent, the IFC said. Wages and salaries alone were $2.3 billion above projections, even before ongoing negotiations are finalised, while employers’ contributions also exceeded estimates. Compensation of employees accounted for nearly half of central government recurrent expenditure during the period, underscoring its significance as one of the least flexible components of the budget. By contrast, capital expenditure — which is more easily deferred — was under-executed by $16.3 billion, or nearly 46 per cent, over the same six-month period, reinforcing concerns that higher wage costs may be accommodated through reduced investment. The IFC noted that Jamaica currently has no active fiscal rule governing wages and salaries and said the Government has given no commitment to reintroducing such a rule, despite repeated recommendations. Following the rebasing of national accounts in 2025, the wage bill stood at about 12.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), lower than earlier estimates, but still elevated by regional and historical standards, according to the commission. The watchdog said the absence of a formal public sector compensation negotiation cycle has contributed to fiscal uncertainty, as wage settlements are often concluded outside the annual budget process, forcing governments to revise spending plans after they have already been approved by Parliament. Section 48H of the Financial Administration and Audit Act provides for the establishment of a structured compensation negotiation cycle aligned with budget preparation. The IFC reiterated that implementing such a framework would improve predictability and reduce fiscal risk. The warning comes as Jamaica faces elevated spending needs after Hurricane Melissa caused an estimated US$8.8 billion in damage. The Government has temporarily suspended fiscal rules under disaster escape clauses and is seeking a two-year extension to its legislated debt-to-GDP target, with public debt projected to rise to 68.2 per cent of GDP by year-end, from 60.3 per cent in September. While acknowledging the exceptional shock, the commission said suspending fiscal rules does not remove the need for credible medium-term adjustment plans as the country moves into a reconstruction phase. {\"xml\":\"xml\"} {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"}",

In its January assessment, the fiscal watchdog said the government’s stronger-than-expected budget performance in the first half of the 2025/26 fiscal year reflected widespread under-execution of capital projects rather than improved implementation capacity — a pattern that could constrain recovery efforts following Hurricane Melissa. The warning comes as the government prepares a major rebuilding programme after the October storm caused an estimated US$8.8 billion in damage, equivalent to about 41 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), and prompted the temporary suspension of Jamaica’s fiscal rules. According to the IFC, central government capital spending between April and September reached just $19.2 billion, nearly 46 per cent below the original budget of $35.5 billion, while the wider specified public sector recorded a surplus of $22.9 billion instead of a planned deficit. The specified public sector comprises central government and most public bodies, excluding the Bank of Jamaica and the Jamaica Mortgage Bank. The commission said repeated underspending had supported near-term fiscal outcomes but masked structural weaknesses in the State’s ability to execute investment programmes. “The continued under-execution of capital expenditure weakens the prospects for future economic growth and higher tax revenue in the medium to long term,” the IFC said, cautioning against what it described as “over-ambition in materially executing additional capital projects amid local capacity constraints.” Self-financing public bodies posted a combined surplus of $38.4 billion in the first half of the fiscal year, compared with a budgeted surplus of just $1.1 billion, largely reflecting delayed or stalled capital projects, the report showed. Jamaica entered the current fiscal year with strong macroeconomic indicators, including declining public debt, low unemployment and improved credit ratings. By September 2025, the debt-to-GDP ratio had fallen to 60.3 per cent, placing the country on track at that time to meet its legislated 60 per cent debt target ahead of schedule. That trajectory has since shifted following Hurricane Melissa, with the government invoking escape clauses in the fiscal rules and seeking a two-year extension to the debt-reduction timeline. Public debt is now projected to rise to 68.2 per cent of GDP by the end of the fiscal year. The IFC said Jamaica’s fiscal buffers and disaster-risk financing arrangements — including access to about US$663 million in contingent resources — had enabled a swift initial response to the shock. International development partners have also mobilised up to $6 billion in potential financing to support recovery and reconstruction. However, the commission stressed that financing was not the binding constraint. Instead, it pointed to long-standing weaknesses in public investment management, including procurement delays, limited project preparation and constrained project-management capacity across ministries and public bodies. The IFC said uncertainty remained over the government’s ability to execute the remaining 72.7 per cent of the capital allocation for the current fiscal year, given the slow pace of spending in the first half. As Jamaica moves into a reconstruction phase, the commission said aligning capital budgets more closely with delivery capacity — and strengthening execution frameworks — would be critical to ensuring that rebuilding efforts translate into durable economic growth rather than short-term fiscal gains. . {\"xml\":\"xml\"} {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"}",

      "content": "The Tunland V9 will join the other commercial vehicle models available from the Foton brand. (Photo: Rory Daley) Auto BY RORY DALEY Auto writer January 30, 2026 Foton picks up new pickup Foton Jamaica launched its newest model, the Tunland V9 full-sized pickup, on Saturday, January 24, at the Oxford Road showroom. “The Tunland V9 is an excellent addition to our model line-up, and we’re super excited to have it here in Jamaica,” Jhanelle Wagstaffe, senior sales manager, Foton, told the Jamaica Observer ’s weekly Auto magazine. The pickup was launched under the theme of dominance as the brand moves into the very rare for the local market full-size segment. The V9 presents a very imposing aura, given that its dimensions are more in line with North American pickups. It’s aimed at the buyer wanting that larger workhorse vehicle, or those looking for more luxury and refinement for when not on the job. The V9 is a technological tour de force, beginning with what’s under the bonnet. The Foton uses a rather unique drivetrain, combining an ultra-high-pressure combustion 2-litre turbo-diesel four-cylinder and a 48-volt mild-hybrid system for strong performance and excellent responsiveness. The electric portion of the drivetrain provides torque assistance and furthers efficiency through energy recovery. An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard. The V9 is four-wheel drive, featuring a standard locking rear differential, 4WD High and Low, plus several off-road modes. Front suspension is double wishbone, while rear suspension is not the expected leaf spring rigid axle design normal for the class, but instead the rarer multi-link layout. This endows the pickup with a smoother ride and improved handling, according to Foton. It can handle a full pallet in the protective spray-coated bed and payloads of up to one tonne. It can tow up to 3.5 tonnes. Ground clearance is 240mm, and wading depth is 700mm. Approach and departure angles are 28 and 26, respectively. Break over angle is 21 degrees. Work-related touches are side steps, a damped tailgate, and an auxiliary tailgate step. Inside, the V9 goes the luxury route, having items such as powered leather seating, ambient lighting, many automated or power-operated convenience features, wireless charging, and digital instrumentation in the form of a 12.3-inch driver’s cluster. The infotainment gets a 14.6-inch touchscreen equipped with Apple CarPlay, and is the output for the 360-degree camera system with the built-in dash-cam function. Safety concerns can be mitigated by six airbags and collision warning systems. For the driving experience, features such as Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Change Assist help on-road, while Hill Descent Assist does wonders off-road. “The V9 is amazing. If you look at the inside, if you look at the outside, it just speaks dominance, presence, versatility, and it’s amazing to have along with the other Foton models we have in Jamaica,” said Wagstaffe. The Tunland V9 joins its smaller sibling, the compact G7, the Miler truck, and the C series buses. “The market has responded favourably to the G7. We have lots of customers on the road so far, and they continue to come in. We have had no complaints about our models. And just adding the V9 to the fleet, I’m expecting to see amazing results from it,” Wagstaffe said. Work features include a built-in tailgate step.(Photo: Rory Daley) Kellise Wong, group marketing manager, ATL Automotive, shares a quick moment with Chris DaCosta, general manager, Foton Jamaica, at the recent launch of the Tunland V9.

      "content": "Patrick Hylton addresses the media during his first press briefing as president of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica in Kingston on Thursday. Business , Caribbean Business Report (CBR) BY KARENA BENNETT Senior business reporter bennettk@jamaicaobserver.com January 30, 2026 Hylton takes PSOJ helm as Jamaica confronts growth test post-Melissa After years spent reshaping Jamaica’s banking sector, Patrick Hylton could have stayed comfortably out of the spotlight. Instead, at a moment when Hurricane Melissa has again exposed how vulnerable Jamaica’s growth path remains, he has stepped back into public leadership with a broader ambition in mind. “This role gives me the opportunity to do what I’ve been doing, but on a grander scale,” Hylton said, explaining his decision to return to public leadership. Hylton, who led the expansion of NCB Financial Group from a troubled local bank into a regional financial institution, was introduced on Thursday as the new president of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica (PSOJ). From his opening remarks, it was clear that he sees the role less as a ceremonial post and more as a platform to influence outcomes. “The responsibility is really about representation. Representing what Jamaican businesses are saying, what they need in order to invest, what they need in order to grow, and what they need to create sustainable employment,” Hylton told journalists during the press briefing. His presidency comes at a sensitive point for the economy. Jamaica has secured a measure of macroeconomic stability, but momentum has been uneven, a challenge now compounded by post-Melissa rebuilding pressures and renewed debate about policy flexibility. Hylton drew a firm line on that issue. “The private sector wants growth, but as responsible citizens and stakeholders, we want growth that aligns with and supports our hard-won economic stability. We can’t trade that for anything,” he said. For Hylton, the constraint is not a lack of ideas, but a failure to convert discussion into delivery. “Growth will not happen in press conferences like we are having here today. It requires productivity. It requires reduced bureaucracy. It requires increased facilitation. It requires discipline,” the newly inducted PSOJ president said. That perspective is informed by experience. Over decades in banking, Hylton helped guide institutions through crisis, restructuring and regional expansion. He now frames Jamaica’s economic challenge in similar terms, as one of scale and the ability to turn disruption into opportunity. “It is difficult to grow in an environment with a limited population. If our businesses are going to grow, we have to scale. We have to expand regionally and globally. The world must become our oyster,” he said. In that context, Hylton argued that Jamaica must move beyond niche exports and more deliberately support firms capable of competing across borders, backed by policies that reward ambition and performance. Technology, he added, should be treated as core infrastructure if companies are to overcome size, cost and geographic constraints. He also pointed to the value of more structured national coordination around growth, drawing on his experience as a founding member of the Economic Programme Oversight Committee (EPOC). While stopping short of a formal proposal, Hylton suggested that a similar framework focused on growth could bring greater continuity to reform efforts. “I had the benefit of being one of the original members of EPOC when it was established many years ago, and I saw the benefit of it, as many of us have seen. If something works that well, I think we should utilise it more. I think there is an opportunity here to leverage that type of framework to improve things,” he said. Crime also featured prominently in his remarks, framed as a direct economic constraint. The cost of security, protection and disruption, he said, diverts resources that could otherwise support investment and productivity. On access to finance, Hylton acknowledged long-standing frustration among smaller businesses and signalled that this would be an early area of engagement under his presidency. Drawing on decades inside the banking system, he said the PSOJ would use his experience and relationships to press for more direct discussions with financial institutions around access to capital, particularly for smaller and growing firms. “There has always been a debate about the role of banks and financial institutions as providers of capital for the development of our businesses, and there have been real challenges. Given my background and experience, I’ve seen it from both sides. I have good relationships in the financial sector, and I’m hoping to engage in a meaningful dialogue on behalf of our members, particularly the smaller ones, to see if we can bridge some of those gaps,” Hylton said Asked why he chose to take on the role at this stage, Hylton further pointed to the satisfaction he draws from building p",

      "content": "Blake Wolfe Older Canadians’ retirement confidence is dropping amid longer life expectancies and a rising percentage of employees who continue to work past age 65, according to a new survey by the National Institute on Ageing at Toronto Metropolitan University. The survey, which polled more than 6,000 Canadians aged 50 and older, found one in five (22 per cent) said they’ve saved $5,000 or less for retirement. A similar percentage reported having between $5,000 and $100,000 (26 per cent) and between $100,000 and $500,000 (24 per cent). Read: Survey finds confidence key to higher retirement savings “It’s really concerning when we know people are living longer — some of these individuals might be looking at a 40-year retirement on less than $100,000,” says Talia Bronstein, the NIA’s director of policy. “We’re also looking at a greater reliance on our publicly-supported income systems like old-age security and the guaranteed income supplement. “It’s concerning for a number of reasons, not only for the well-being of those individuals and their ability to afford food and shelter and all of those important things, but also that strain on public systems.” Indeed, the survey found more than a third (35 per cent) of Canadians aged 50 and older said they were working, while 52 per cent said they were retired. While employment rates were highest among Canadians aged 50 to 64 (58 per cent), nearly a fifth (15 per cent) of those aged 65 to 79 and four per cent of Canadians aged 80 and older said they’re still working. Among Canadians aged 50 and older who haven’t yet retired, the percentage of those who feel they can afford to retire at their desired time has declined from 35 per cent in 2022 to 29 per cent in 2025. Over the same period, those who said they can’t afford to retire at their desired time rose from 37 per cent to 43 per cent, while roughly a quarter said they remain unsure. Read: Six employees discuss their personal roads to retirement The survey’s findings support the need for employers to provide robust retirement savings vehicles to support workers’ financial wellness, says Bronstein. In addition to providing group retirement plans, employers can also support older employees by adjusting terms of employment to meet individual needs. “It might be in terms of accessibility [or] more flexibility — some people might be looking for reduced hours, but they want to remain working so the more flexibility that employers can provide these employees can really be beneficial.” Changes to government policy and legislation around retirement, particularly Canada and Quebec Pension Plan benefits, can also support Canadian workers who are facing uncertainty in retirement. The NIA recently petitioned the federal Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Jobs and Families with a letter advocating for a pension delay guarantee. Read: OAS increase an opportunity for employees to consider delaying retirement: expert Bronstein explains this guarantee would support Canadians who delay taking CPP/QPP benefits by reimbursing, in the event of early death, their estate with the difference between the benefits they actually received and what would’ve been received had benefits been claimed at age 60. In 2020, the NIA published a report that found the average Canadian taking CPP/QPP benefits at age 60 instead of waiting until age 70 can expect to lose more than $100,000 of secure lifetime income. “It’s a safety net and [the pension delay guarantee] addresses Canadians’ No. 1 fear of delaying CPP/QPP benefits, which is the fear of missing out. It’s not a financial calculus issue that people are having — it’s actually a psychological one. It’s a really exciting opportunity to nudge people in the direction of delaying claiming their CPP/QPP benefits [and] it’s a really powerful thing the government can do with low cost.” Read: Survey finds Canadian employees delaying retirement due to rising cost of living",

      "content": "Bryan McGovern The Pension Investment Association of Canada will monitor the ongoing progress of several policies related to environmental and sustainability solutions. Last year’s federal budget indicated greenwashing provisions would be coming to the Competition Act at a time when the pension association has advocated for clear and flexible environmental, social and governance reporting guidelines, which would help prevent greenwashing and greenhushing tactics, said Asif Haque, chair of the board at PIAC and the chief investment officer at the CAAT Pension Plan, in an emailed statement to Benefits Canada . Read: PIAC urging CSA to resume work on climate disclosure mandate Similarly, the association wants to see the government establish a globally-aligned climate-related financial disclosure rule set to help streamline climate consideration in institutional investment decision-making. The rule would be essential in developing Canada’s economic edge, he said, noting it could also improve durability amid the financial, economic and societal costs of climate change. The feds are moving ahead with a Canadian made sustainable investment guideline and Haque said PIAC will monitor its progress throughout the year. “Taxonomy development plays a crucial role in the net-zero transition by guiding and mobilizing green and transition capital.” It will also continue to push for the reinstatement of a real return bonds program in Canada’s fixed income market. Last year’s budget failed to address whether the asset would make a comeback, but Haque said a return would restore a critical tool for managing inflation risk and strengthen Canada’s investment landscape. Read: Quebec introducing VPLA regulatory framework Continuing one of its trends from last year, PIAC will continue to monitor the harmonization of the regulatory framework for variable payment life annuities, which Haque said provides “a much-needed decumulation solution for defined contribution plans, addressing a gap in retirement planning that was once overlooked.” It’s also advocating for the implementation of a single going-concern plus funding framework. A shift away from dual funding regime in favour of a unified funding framework would strengthen the long-term sustainability of defined benefit pension plans, he said. In 2026, the organization will also monitor ongoing challenges from geopolitical uncertainty, which is increasing market volatility and regulatory risk across key markets. Long-term risk assessment is more complicated in an environment with “trade tensions and shifting alliances,” he added. Read: PIAC, ACPM asking federal government to bring back real return bonds Global institutional investors are facing uncertainty from increasing international policy divergence, which is also complicating ESG and stewardship efforts for pension plans and external managers, according to Haque. This challenge is particularly seen through recent rollbacks of shareholder rights and corporate governance standards in the U.S., he said. For the association, 2025 was defined by growth in reach and services to members, and through a new strategic plan it will continue building on its influence and effectiveness. Haque said 2025 was a year of increased deployment of pension plan capital in the domestic market for PIAC members. “Without compromising our members’ fiduciary duty to pension plan beneficiaries, government can create the necessary conditions for increased domestic investment. Importantly, our members can offer government valuable insights into strategies for enhancing this investment opportunity.” Read: Unified ‘going-concern plus’ regime, reinstating real return bonds among PIAC’s 2025 priorities",

Last year, the organization began working with Université du Québec à Montréal for its research chair in actuarial and climate sciences, an initiative designed to improve understanding of the financial impacts of climate change and to help society adapt. Read: Quebec adopts VPLA legislation “It’s an area that’s really going to support public policy decision around some of the climate risk that’s happening [and will] provide actuaries with the tools in terms of risk modeling and analyzing climate change. . . . It’s obviously going to impact the liability side as well as the investment side of things.” The CIA will also continue its work on how variable payment life annuities will impact actuaries, as more jurisdictions adopt legislation around VPLAs. In December, Quebec formally adopted legislation that allows plan sponsors offer the option, including conditions related to plan design, valuation and administration. In November, Ontario announced it’s developing a legislative framework that would permit VPLAs to be offered from pooled registered pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and pension plans that provide for additional voluntary contributions. Read: Ontario taking steps to end preferred pharmacy networks, introducing VPLA framework Similarly, the organization continues to monitor developments in target-benefit pension legislation, such as in Ontario. This year, the organization will also publish an updated mortality table following research into the impact of gender identity on longevity risk. The growth of artificial intelligence is also on the CIA’s radar in 2026 and beyond, says Graham. “Like everyone else, we’re trying to navigate [AI] and as we think about the future, it’s really about making sure we continue to be fit for purpose and that we are giving our actuaries the tools required to be able to function in this rapidly changing world.” Read: What’s the impact of gender identity in determining longevity risk?",

Korinne Collins, chief executive officer at the ACPM, notes flexibility across the accumulation and decumulation stages is rising on the industry’s agenda as governments and regulators focus on fewer higher-impact issues. Read: ACPM focusing on flexible pension models, CAPSA guidelines in 2025 “I think it’s getting higher on the list,” Collins notes, pointing to recent federal shifts. “It’s focusing on what really matters.” Regulators also appear to be taking a more streamlined approach, concentrating on areas where guidance and supervision can have the greatest impact. “Maybe fewer, but more important things to focus on, or where they want to add some guidance.” That approach aligns with the updated capital accumulation plan and risk management guidance from the Canadian Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities , which plan sponsors implemented on Jan. 1. While ACPM members continue working toward alignment, the guidance focuses less on day-to-day operations and more on longer-term planning. Read: More clarity, flexibility needed in solvency reserve accounts for federally regulated DB pension plans: ACPM “We’re not seeing a significant shift in operational activity. The focus is on preparing for future risks rather than managing funds differently on a daily basis.” Collins points to an opportunity for pension plans to take a broader view of members across their career and into retirement, as the conversation increasingly moves beyond accumulation. “For a long time, plans have focused on saving. What’s becoming more important is what options are available to members as they move beyond accumulation.” Collaboration among plan sponsors and more consistent communication also remain important, given the complexity of pension plans. “The more we’re seeing the same sorts of things, the clearer it is for members and the average consumer.” Read: How CAPSA’s updated CAP guideline will impact plan sponsors, members Looking ahead, plans that understand their member segments and how needs evolve over time will be better positioned, with the industry continuing to learn collectively. “There’s a lot of talent and passion in the pension industry; everyone is focused on how important strong retirement income is for members.”",

      "content": "Staff The Quebec government has adopted regulations allowing defined contribution pension plans and voluntary retirement savings plans to offer variable payment life annuities. The regulatory changes establish the framework under which DC plans and voluntary retirement savings plans may offer the lifetime income option, including conditions related to plan design, valuation and administration. The move follows draft regulations and consultations earlier this year aimed at expanding decumulation options for plan members. Read: Quebec’s VPLA rollout would benefit from more flexible approach: CIA Variable payment life annuities are designed to provide retirees with a lifetime income stream that fluctuates based on investment performance and other actuarial factors, without requiring the purchase of an individual annuity. Proponents have said the model can help support retirement income security while offering greater flexibility within capital accumulation plans. Quebec is among the first Canadian jurisdictions to adopt a comprehensive regulatory framework permitting VPLAs in both DC plans and voluntary retirement savings plans.

      "content": "Sadie Janes Half (50 per cent) of Canadian employers are now offering financial planning services and 42 per cent are providing financial literacy resources, according to a new report by Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. This is a significant increase from 2024, notes Pat Leo, vice-president of Toronto retirement at Gallagher. “With carriers in Canada now offering some type of financial-planning or wealth-management service, more plan sponsors are feeling comfortable with the idea of offering these services to their employees.” The report, which analyzed data from more than 540 organizations across Canada, found 92 per cent indicated retirement savings and investment options are a top priority, and 40 per cent reported financial well-being — including retirement — has become more important. Read: How employers can design effective financial wellness programs Additionally, employers are steadily shifting toward combined base and matching contributions — rising from 16 per cent in 2023 to 22 per cent in 2025. “When you look at the matching formula, the beautiful thing about offering a base [within a group registered retirement savings plan arrangement] is that it really demonstrates a strong commitment to plan members,” says Leo. “You might have plan members that would love to participate in the plan, but they can’t afford to. When new people join and already have one per cent, it might eventually stimulate more interest for them to start saving . . . and it might also stimulate more savings from existing plan members. And frankly, it’s quite simple to do.” The report also found employers are expanding choice and accessibility with plan options and customizable features, with 31 per cent offering group tax-free savings accounts to give employees more control over how they save. “Our survey suggests that employees value choice, and [regarding] retirement we’re seeing this trend of adding [different types of] savings accounts,” notes Leo. “For example, some clients previously just offered a RRSP or [deferred profit-sharing plan] and now they’re thinking they should add a TFSA because they might have members that would really benefit from it. More recently, carriers have started to introduce the first home savings account, which some plan sponsors are considering offering to plan members.” Read: FHSA may work best in conjunction with group RRSP, TFSA Starting Jan. 1, 2026, a new guideline from the Canadian Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities advises plan sponsors to implement detailed frameworks for transparency, risk management and participant protection in employer-sponsored savings plans. “This guideline has created an interesting move from a focus on member communication and information to now member communication and education. So we’ve been talking with plan sponsors about how they’ll need to have a solid education strategy moving into 2026 to reflect these updated guidelines. I think the education communication is going to be top of mind and we’re doing our part to make sure our clients have an increased focus on that moving forward.” To help improve retirement readiness, Leo suggests employers work with their consultants and carriers to better understand their financial planning and wellness offerings, revisit their financial education strategy with the upcoming CAPSA guideline, and possibly engage in a discussion with the retirement or pension committee to decide if it’s time to refresh their plan design.

      "content": "Staff Roughly a third (34 per cent) of global employees say they expect to work at least part time after retiring, a percentage that increases to 37 per cent among U.S. employees, according to a new survey by T. Rowe Price. The survey — which polled more than 7,000 employees in Australia, Canada, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. — found nearly a fifth (17 per cent) believe they’ll run out of money in retirement and only 27 per cent said they’re confident they could withstand a major financial shock while retired. Only 31 per cent of respondents said they expect to live as well or better in retirement. This pessimism was most pronounced in Japan and Australia, while optimism was highest among U.K. employees. Retirement confidence also differs by gender, as women — especially single women — reported significantly lower retirement confidence compared to men. Notably, in Australia, 31 per cent of men reported high confidence versus only 15 per cent of women. Read: Survey finds confidence key to higher retirement savings Excitement for retirement is linked to financial confidence and progress. About a third of employees said they’re excited for retirement and these respondents are more likely to be higher earners and married. They’re also twice as likely to report progress toward their financial goals. More than two‑thirds (68 per cent) of plan members said they prefer to choose how their retirement savings are invested, though this group was roughly split between those wanting choice with educational support (35 per cent) and those confident in their investment decisions (33 per cent). About one in five (22 per cent) indicated they prefer their retirement savings be automatically invested for them. Canadian employees were the most likely to favour defaults (27 per cent), while Japanese employees expressed the least comfort with a default investment (16 per cent).
