      "content": "CRA responsiveness doubled as the 100-Day Service Improvement Plan reaches completion From: Canada Revenue Agency News release Since launching the 100-day Service Improvement Plan earlier this year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has made considerable and marked progress in reducing client wait times, improving service standards, and scaling up new technologies into its processes—all while improving user-friendly services. December 11, 2025 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency Since launching the 100-day Service Improvement Plan earlier this year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has made considerable and marked progress in reducing client wait times, improving service standards, and scaling up new technologies into its processes—all while improving user-friendly services. The 100-Day Service plan was introduced in response to overwhelming service pressures that failed to live up to Canadians’ expectations. It was rooted in four priority areas – improving call response, expanding digital self-service tools, addressing the root causes of service issues, and accelerating service modernization. As the plan concludes, the CRA is reporting meaningful progress across all areas. Call wait times have decreased, digital services are enhanced to make access easier for Canadians, and individuals and businesses receive more efficient support navigating the tax system. On day 101 and beyond, the CRA must continue delivering the level of service Canadians expect and deserve, especially as the upcoming tax-filing season approaches. This is paramount to rebuilding trust in the agency and strengthening service experiences. Renewed efforts to further improve service will draw on these accomplishments and the agency’s forward momentum to drive sustained efficiencies into the new year and beyond. This includes: Better access to phone agents: The number of unique calls answered more than doubled – from 35% to more than 70%, with peaks of 92% – through the extension of term contracts and the rehiring of approximately 1,250 employees to help reduce wait times. A scheduled callback has been implemented for issues related to CRA account access, providing support to more than 59,000 Canadians so far. Easier and more useful digital services: People who lose or forget their CRA sign-in information can now quickly regain access to their account online instead of calling. A new “Manage Balance ” feature lets Canadians make payments or set up payment arrangements in their CRA Account without speaking to an agent. The GenAI chatbot beta can now answer a wider range of questions, including more complex ones for businesses, such as tax credits and compliance information. The document verification service has made CRA account registration quicker, with 88% of new users gaining immediate access in October 2025 , mitigating approximately 300,000 phone calls per year. Updates to Canada.ca/Taxes make it easier to find clear information on benefits, credits, how to open a CRA account, and how long processing will take. Tackling the root causes of service issues: A targeted plan was implemented to reduce wait times for tax adjustments, Disability Tax Credit (DTC) applications, and Canada Child Benefit claims. Reallocating service representatives to these areas resulted in more than 23,000 additional DTC cases being processed, while maintaining the 70% call-answer target. New system enhancement will enable CRA to automatically process roughly 115,000 more tax adjustment requests annually. Accelerating long-term modernization: Phone services were updated so payment-related questions go straight to specialists. This helps Canadians get answers on the first call and avoids about 95,000 transfers each year. Work is being accelerated on a new contact platform that will give Canadians a more modern, consistent service experience by summer 2026. For the complete list of improvements, visit the 100-Day Service Improvement Plan webpage. Looking ahead: Continuous service improvements for tax season As preparations continue for the upcoming tax season, the CRA is building on recent progress to improve clarity, accuracy, and accessibility of services. In the months ahead, the CRA will continue strengthening security measures, streamlining processes to reduce wait times, and expanding the use of digital services—including artificial intelligence and automation—to deliver faster, more responsive service. As tax season approaches, call volumes are expected to rise significantly. Last year, the CRA received more than 32 million calls—peaking at nearly 300,000 a day during filing season. To help manage this surge, term contracts are being extended and additional contact centre staff are being hired, supported by enhanced training focused on accuracy and completeness. Several new services are also being introduced to make interactions with the CRA easier: An updated Progress tracker, that provides individuals, businesses, and their representatives with status updat",

      "content": "CRA strengthens compliance in trucking sector by lifting the moratorium on T4A penalties From: Canada Revenue Agency News release Trucking is vital to connecting Canada’s vast and expansive territory and bridging our united economies. December 4, 2025 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency Trucking is vital to connecting Canada’s vast and expansive territory and bridging our united economies. But tax non-compliance in the trucking sector has allowed some companies to avoid tax obligations, undercutting compliant competitors and denying workers the benefits and pensions they have earned. To restore fairness, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is making changes to improve compliance in the trucking industry. As of today, the CRA has lifted the moratorium on penalties for failing to report fees for services for the 2025 tax year and subsequent tax years. Businesses in this sector will now be assessed penalties if they fail to report payments for services exceeding $500 in a calendar year that are made to a Canadian-controlled private corporation in the trucking industry. These payments must be reported to the CRA in box 048 – fees for services – of the T4A slip by February 28, 2026 . Since this date falls on a Saturday, an information return will be considered on time if the CRA receives it or it is postmarked on or before March 2, 2026 . A business is considered to be operating in the trucking industry if more than 50% of its primary source of income is from trucking activities. These updated reporting requirements will help improve transparency, strengthen compliance, and ensure both payers and workers are meeting their tax obligations, while supporting fair working conditions and safer roads for all Canadians. They build on the strategic investments announced in Budget 2025, which enhance the CRA’s capacity to address non-compliance in the trucking industry. The CRA will publish further guidance in the coming weeks to help businesses determine whether they are affected and understand how to meet their reporting obligations. Quotes “Driver misclassification undermines workers, distorts competition for honest businesses, and puts safety at risk. By lifting the T4A penalties moratorium, we are reinforcing fairness in the trucking industry, ensuring drivers receive the protections they are owed, and contributing to safer roads for all Canadians, while making sure everyone pays their fair share.” The Honourable Francois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Finance and National Revenue ( Tweet this quote. ) “Canada’s supply chains rely on a strong, competitive, and fair trucking industry. Today’s announcement is an important step toward ensuring a level playing field for the thousands of operators who keep our economy moving. By supporting greater transparency and compliance, we are helping to build a trucking sector that continues to be safe, more resilient, and better positioned to serve Canadians and our trading partners.” The Honourable Steven MacKinnon, Minister of Transport and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons ( Tweet this quote. ) “To build the strongest economy in the G7 we need a strong and skilled workforce. Canadians rely on the work of truck drivers every day to get our goods to market and to keep our economy moving. We are focused on ensuring a level playing field for the trucking industry and its drivers.” The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Jobs and Families and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario ( Tweet this quote. ) “By lifting the penalty moratorium on reporting fees for Services (RFS) in the trucking industry, Canada’s new government is cracking down on Driver Inc., closing loopholes, making our roads safer, and standing up for businesses and drivers that play by the rules.” The Honourable Wayne Long, Secretary of State (Canada Revenue Agency and Financial Institutions) ( Tweet this quote. ) Quick facts RFS is the legislated requirement for businesses and organizations to report fees paid to other businesses for services provided. Under the Income Tax Act, payments that exceed $500 in a calendar year must be reported to the CRA in prescribed form, usually the T4A slip. In 2011, the CRA introduced a moratorium on assessing penalties for failing to complete box 048, Fees for services, on the T4A slip. This was meant to allow businesses and organizations time to gain familiarity with the RFS requirement and adopt practices to comply. To restore fairness to the sector and ensure workers are receiving the benefits they deserve, Budget 2025 proposes $77.0 million over four years, starting in 2026-2027 , with ongoing funding of $19.2 million annually, for the CRA to lift the moratorium on the penalties for failure to report fees for service transactions in the trucking industry and to implement a focused program that addresses non-compliance issues related to personal services businesses (PSBs) and RFS.

The fourth edition of the GFIP was hosted by the Canada Revenue Agency in Ottawa, Canada October 24, 2024 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency The Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) welcomed financial institutions, banking associations, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) representatives and other partners at the fourth Global Financial Institutions Partnership (GFIP) Summit to discuss effective practices in combating tax and financial crime. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), in close co-operation with the other J5 members, organized the two-day international summit on public-private co-operation against tax and financial crime in Ottawa, Canada, October 22 and 23, 2024. This international summit gathered more than 100 participants from all five J5 countries— Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. This international summit brought together experts from the public and private sector to discuss the challenges and opportunities in addressing, managing and mitigating current and future tax and financial crime risks. It provided a space for open dialogue and discussion, enhancing our networks through engaging panel discussions and presentations. The summit had a variety of wide-ranging topics of common interest for the GFIP partners involved. It focused on three topics that are at the forefront for GFIP, namely identity theft-based crimes, misuse of financial technology, and trade-based money laundering. The conference’s panel discussions were led by senior representatives from banking institutions, bank associations, FIUs and the five J5 countries. This edition of the GFIP Summit focused on the development of typology papers and other threat-focused projects. “The CRA was honoured to have hosted the 2024 GFIP Summit. Tax and financial crime are constantly evolving and we must adjust and adapt to an everchanging environment,” said Eric Ferron, Canada’s J5 Chief, and Director General of the Criminal Investigations Directorate at the CRA. “The GFIP Summit provides a perfect forum for key senior leaders in the financial and tax sector to address our challenges through public-private partnerships, where we can collaborate to find ways to combat international tax evasion, financial crime, and money laundering.” “The insights and strategies shared at this year's GFIP Summit demonstrated the value in global collaboration and innovation in the face of tax and financial crime. These knowledge-sharing opportunities are crucial to driving impactful change in the global financial ecosystem,” said Jade Hawkins , Acting J5 Chief and Deputy Commissioner at the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). “This year, the J5 has held their fourth GFIP Summit. We were welcomed by our dear colleagues from the CRA who hosted the event in Ottawa, Canada, where we participated in enlightening two-day discussions on key and emerging threats, project development updates and relationship building,” said Niels Obbink, Director General, Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD). “We discussed in depth Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML), specifically in relation to the plastic waste sector. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands have worked with private sector partners and the FIU’s to carry out a detailed analysis of the sector's exposure to potential TBML, creating a method that is potentially replicable across other GFIP stakeholders and J5 partners. The next steps for this work include operationalising that insight to support multi-agency intervention activities. I look forward to the upcoming results from this and other GFIP projects.” “Tax authorities cannot tackle tax crime alone. Businesses have a vital role to play in the fight against those who would undermine our economies and our communities. That’s why the GFIP is so important. The public and private sector working together to identify threats, share knowledge and target those intent on causing harm,” said Richard Las, Director of the Fraud Investigation Service at His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). “I’m delighted at what we’ve achieved during this summit. We’ve strengthened our partnerships and made real progress against key threats, including identity crime and TBML. It’s a shining example of what can be accomplished when we bring our collective skill, expertise and commitment to the table.” “The time investment from every bank attending the GFIP Summit speaks volumes about their desire to work together to combat international tax evasion,” said Guy Ficco, Chief, Internal Revenue Service",

      "content": "J5 publishes first report detailing the alliance’s global impact From: Canada Revenue Agency News release The Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) released its first Report July 24, 2024 detailing the global impact of operations, public-private partnerships, and stakeholder engagement since it’s inception in 2018. July 25, 2024 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency Operational results, training and partnership highlight J5’s first six years WASHINGTON – The Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) released its first Report July 24, 2024 detailing the global impact of operations, public-private partnerships, and stakeholder engagement since it’s inception in 2018. During the J5’s first six years, it has generated more than a hundred leads, seized millions of dollars in criminal proceeds, issued notices to financial institutions and thwarted fraudulent investment and boiler-room schemes. The Report details current statistics from the J5 Cyber Group, noting that the team is currently working more than 30 active cybercrime investigations and that 10 active investigations stemmed from leads produced at the 2023 J5 Cyber Challenge in Ottawa, Canada. The J5 has also provided training to multiple countries across the globe, including South Africa, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Ukraine. It also notes successes of the J5 Professional Enablers Group, including criminal charges against 15 individuals with ties to a boiler-room scheme and tax evasion charges against a United States (U.S.) defense contractor. This group is dedicated to tackling institutions, promoters and service-providers who facilitate and enable tax evasion and money laundering. The J5 considers the launch of the Global Financial Institutions Partnership (GFIP) as one of its biggest achievements. This partnership has engaged more than 20 financial institutions to collaborate on shared priority threats. Representatives from the GFIP convene yearly at a summit to strategize on the best ways to combat financial and tax crimes. “Six years ago, our five countries took a chance and publicly joined together to root out tax crimes,” said Guy Ficco, Chief, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation (CI). “We have learned a tremendous amount by working together and we are now an organization firing on all cylinders with real operational results – results that would not exist were it not for the J5. I’m proud of what we have accomplished together, but I’m also excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead.” “The J5 was bought together for the purpose of tackling tax crime—it’s a global problem and we answered it with a global solution,” said John Ford, Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). “We can’t afford to work in isolation whilst organised criminals and tax cheats manipulate the system and exploit vulnerabilities for their personal gain. Over the past six years, we’ve had some great achievements which wouldn’t have been possible without this network, and I’m confident our successes will continue in the years to come.” “Our outstanding collaboration is one of the main pillars of the J5,” said Eric Ferron, Chief, Canada Revenue Agency’s (CRA) Criminal Investigations Directorate. “This collaboration has only increased over time, and has become ever more important. The J5 members and our partners will once again have the opportunity to showcase their innovative and ambitious work in tackling global tax crime at the upcoming GFIP Summit in the Fall of 2024 in Ottawa, Canada. As the host of this event, I am looking forward to further our work with our public and private sector partners on high priority tax threats.” “Since the launch of the J5 in 2018, we have focused on jointly fighting tax fraud, cyber-focused fraud and money laundering, a playing field we as the Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD) have traditionally been strong in. It is a unique informal international cooperation aimed at combating and preventing cross-border fraud. Unique because of its focus on operational results,” said Niels Obbink, Director General, FIOD. “Some notable results include Operation Atlantis; where signals from the Netherlands and other J5 countries led to a global investigation, Bestmixer; taking the mix service offline, the crypto challenges and the publication of risk indicators linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrency assets. Since its inception, cooperation between countries has gained momentum. This is necessary because criminals are increasingly using borders to their advantage. Full of ambition, we look forward to further intensifying our cooperation.” “From a bold idea to a fully-fledged operational alliance, in just six years the J5 has become the leading force in tackling international tax crime,” said Richard Las, Director, Fraud Investigation Service, His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). “We know that criminals don't recognise or respect our borders.

      "content": "The CRA invites taxpayers to share ideas for service improvements From: Canada Revenue Agency News release The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is committed to providing a high-quality service experience for taxpayers and benefit recipients. September 25, 2024 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is committed to providing a high-quality service experience for taxpayers and benefit recipients. To deliver on these efforts, the CRA is launching public consultations to hear from individuals, non-professional representatives, and tax intermediaries about their experiences with CRA services. The CRA service consultations 2024 will play an important role in further understanding the experiences of those who rely on CRA services, and identifying areas where improvements are needed. As the CRA adapts to an ever-changing environment, ensuring our services remain accessible, responsive, and tailored to the evolving needs of clients is our top priority. How to participate From September 25 to December 2, 2024 , individuals, non-professional representatives, and tax intermediaries have the opportunity to share feedback on their experiences interacting with CRA services through an online questionnaire. The CRA will also hold both in-person and virtual consultation sessions with members of these groups by invitation, allowing for more in-depth discussions. Every voice matters : participate in the online questionnaire to share your feedback and help shape the future of CRA services. To ensure the privacy of participants and that a wide range of perspectives is captured, the recruitment of participants and reporting will be managed by an independent third party. What we hope to learn As the world changes with new technologies and evolving trends, your expectations of government services are also shifting. The CRA is the administrator of a complex tax system and recognizes the need to be responsive to these changes to deliver services that strive to put people first. We know taxpayers and benefit recipients deserve a better service experience and we want to focus on what matters most to them. This is why we need feedback. Through these consultations, we aim to understand the specific challenges they are facing and identify areas where our services fall short of their expectations. How feedback shapes improvements Over the past few years, there has been a growing demand for digital-first, seamless experiences, prompting the CRA to modernize its services to enhance ease of access. Previous feedback has been pivotal in driving service improvements, and these consultations are another important step in ensuring our services address the needs of our clients. Recent key improvements include: Introducing a digital application for the Disability Tax Credit to streamline the process for those who rely on this essential support. Enhancing the CRA’s sign-in services to ensure faster and more secure access to online accounts. Implementing the Learn about your taxes online learning tool to help young people better understand and manage their tax obligations. Increasing Contact Centre hours to improve access to timely support, recognizing the challenges individuals and businesses face in reaching us, we are working to ensure they can get the help they need when they need it. Expanding the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) , which helps vulnerable and lower-income populations access free tax-filing support. While we’ve made progress, the CRA recognizes that challenges remain and there is still more work to be done. Encouraging participation in these consultations will play a key role in shaping the future of CRA programs and services, making it easier for taxpayers to understand their tax obligations and receive the benefits and credits they may be eligible for.

      "content": "Peter Routledge, Superintendent, gives OSFI Domestic Stability Buffer Announcement – December 2025 Speech - Virtual - December 18, 2025 Check against delivery Welcome to our December 2025 rate-setting announcement for the Domestic Stability Buffer, or DSB. I am speaking to you from Ottawa on land that has long served as a meeting place amongst Indigenous peoples, including the Anishinaabeg Algonquin Nation, the traditional keepers of this land. I am grateful to be present in this territory. The DSB is a capital buffer that enables Canada’s six domestic, systemically important banks, or D-SIBs, to absorb losses and continue lending to households and businesses during periods of stress. Today, we maintain the DSB at 3.5% of total risk-weighted assets. Several conditions factored into our decision: though stable, systemic vulnerabilities remain elevated; the DSB at its current level of 3.5% is proportionate to systemic vulnerabilities in OSFI’s view; near-term risks remain manageable as Canada’s banks continue to generate solid earnings despite a challenging operating environment; and with strong capital positions, Canada’s D-SIBs are not capital constrained, and have ample capacity to support households and businesses as economic and financial conditions evolve. Moreover, since systemic vulnerabilities are stable, and in some cases below past highs, OSFI does not expect to increase the DSB from its current level absent a significant change in vulnerabilities. OSFI also judges that the DSB range of 0% to 4% is consistent with low probability, high severity stress scenarios, enabling OSFI to respond when and if vulnerabilities intensify or moderate. OSFI has deliberately built up the DSB over time to ensure Canada’s largest banks have the resilience to support the financial system during periods of uncertainty. Canada’s largest banks hold strong capital levels, with Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios well above our supervisory expectation of 11.5%, averaging 13.6% across the sector. The DSB is a balanced, made-in-Canada capital buffer. Unlike counter-cyclical capital buffers globally, a breach of the DSB would not result in automatic capital restrictions such as dividend cuts or a cessation of common share repurchases. In the event of a breach, OSFI would expect a bank to provide a remediation plan for returning capital back above the DSB-implied floor. Automatic capital restrictions would only occur if a bank breached the minimum for an adequately capitalized systemically important bank of 8% on its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1). Banks have a sizable capital cushion above the DSB and the DSB range; the cushion over the current DSB CET1 floor is over $60 billion; the cushion over the DSB range is more than $45 billion. Ultimately, institutions determine how to allocate the capacity provided by their capital cushions by choosing amongst many options; which could include sustaining the prudentially sound shift towards the provision of credit for Canadian businesses, including small- and medium-sized enterprises, as they adapt to current conditions. We continue to closely monitor existing vulnerabilities and risks, including still elevated and increasing household indebtedness, uncertainty in housing and commercial real estate, and some signs of strain in credit such as gradually rising delinquencies and provisions in certain consumer and business segments. A decision to release the DSB will be a data-informed call based on how risks are evolving in real time. A release does not in and of itself signal a risk event; rather, it reflects OSFI’s independent judgment that systemic vulnerabilities have either materialized or have meaningfully dissipated. As such, a DSB release should not be viewed as new information or a market-moving forecast, but as a routine adjustment to evolving economic conditions. We continue to monitor the environment closely and will make further adjustments to the DSB as conditions warrant. Thank you.",

      "content": "OSFI holds Domestic Stability Buffer at 3.5%, reflecting resilience in a changing risk environment News release - December 18, 2025 Today, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) announced that the Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) will remain at 3.5% of total risk-weighted assets. OSFI first announced this level in June 2023. Canada’s six largest banks continue to maintain resilient capital levels, with Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios well above the supervisory expectation of 11.5%, at an average of 13.6% across the sector. This sizable capital cushion equates to roughly $60 billion. In OSFI’s judgment, the major vulnerabilities in the banking system remain elevated but stable. Canadian household debt, relative to income, remains high but relatively stable and below historical peaks given softer conditions in the housing market. Canadian corporate debt growth has moderated but credit quality is vulnerable to trade-related headwinds. Low credit spreads and high earnings multiples remain a feature of capital markets in Canada and abroad. Meanwhile, global uncertainty, including geopolitical risks, continues to shape the overall risk environment. OSFI has held the DSB steady because its level is proportionate to these vulnerabilities. Moreover, since systemic vulnerabilities are stable, and in some cases below past highs, OSFI does not expect to increase the DSB from its current level. OSFI also judges that the DSB range of 0% to 4% is consistent with low probability, high severity stress scenarios. Were vulnerabilities to materialize into significant costs to the financial system, OSFI would lower the DSB. OSFI would see such an adjustment as a routine response to changes in the risk environment. More information about OSFI’s decision can be found in the Decision Summary Note . Quote OSFI uses the DSB tool to ensure Canada’s six systemically important banks hold capital that is appropriate for the level of risk in the financial system. This underpins the resilience of Canada’s financial sector. Today, Canada’s six largest banks hold capital levels well above supervisory expectations. This enables them to provide core banking services to the Canadian economy throughout the business cycle. Quick facts The DSB applies to Canada’s six biggest banks, known as Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs). OSFI expects D-SIBs to maintain a total Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio to at least 11.5% of risk-weighted assets, all currently exceed 13% with an average of 13.6%. OSFI reviews and sets the DSB level twice a year, in June and December, and can adjust it at any time if conditions warrant. Decisions are based on a wide range of indicators, stress-testing results, and supervisory judgment. Contacts OSFI – Media Relations Media-Medias@osfi-bsif.gc.ca 343-550-9373",

      "content": "Chief Actuary of the Government of Canada releases 32nd Actuarial Report on the Canada Pension Plan News release - Ottawa - December 8, 2025 Today, the Office of the Chief Actuary (OCA) released the 32nd Actuarial Report on the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) after it was tabled in Parliament, confirming that the CPP remains sustainable for generations to come. The Actuarial Report on the Canada Pension Plan assesses the plan’s long-term financial sustainability and guides policy decisions that affect millions of Canadians. It builds public trust by providing transparent, expert analysis of demographic, economic, and investment trends. The previous report, the 31st Actuarial Report on the Canada Pension Plan , was tabled in the House of Commons on December 14, 2022. In early 2026, the 32nd Actuarial Report on the CPP will undergo a review by an external panel of peer reviewers who are Fellows of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries and recognized for their extensive experience in risk management, governance, funding, and design of pension plans and social security programs. Quote \"The findings of 32nd Actuarial Report on the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) reaffirm that the CPP is on solid financial footing and will continue to provide reliable retirement income for Canadians for decades to come.\" Quick facts Statutory contribution rates are sufficient to financially sustain both the base and additional CPP over the long term. More Canadians are contributing. The number of people paying into the CPP is expected to grow from 16.1 million in 2025 to 19.3 million by 2050. Base CPP assets are projected to rise from $651 billion at the end of 2024 to about $2.9 trillion by 2050, with investment income making up nearly half of revenues by then. For the additional CPP, assets are expected to grow from $54 billion at the end of 2024 to $1.4 trillion by 2050, with investment income projected to represent 62% of revenues. Contributions staying ahead of costs. For the base CPP, contributions are projected to be higher than benefits paid until 2030, and for the additional CPP, until 2057. More retirees are receiving benefits. The number of people receiving retirement benefits from the base CPP is expected to increase from 6.4 million in 2025 to 9.5 million by 2050 while it is expected to increase from 1.5 million to 8.6 million over the same period for the additional CPP.

Pension Industry Must Bolster Bridges to Steel Against Uncertain Future: BCFSA Senior VP Nez Aquino In an uncertain global economy, B.C.’s and Canada’s pension plan industry must show resilience and strengthen its existing bridges to prepare for a future that may look very different from the past. That was among the messages delivered October 30 by Nez Aquino, BCFSA’s Senior Vice President of Financial Institutions, during her keynote address to the Association of Canadian Pension Management B.C. Council’s “Pension Perspectives” forum. BCSFA is working to help ensure that the pension system is well positioned to weather demographic and macroeconomic pressures and can continue serving Canadians during uncertain times through rigorous oversight, proactive risk management, and ensuring plan administrators are prepared for the future. Read the full text of Aquino’s speech below. Speech | Nez Aquino, October 30, 2025 Check against delivery. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks very much for the kind introduction. We build bridges so that they are strong enough to carry the weight of generations. And in many ways, our pension system is a bridge. In the universe of pension plans, we each play our part in helping maintain that bridge, reinforcing it as new pressures arise so that everyone who crosses it, from today’s workers to tomorrow’s retirees—can trust it will hold. That is what resilience looks like in our sector: strengthening the structure that connects us across time. But as we know, Canada’s economy stands at an inflection point shaped not only by domestic realities but by a world in flux . Geopolitical tensions, shifting trade relationships, and the global transition to cleaner energy are redefining the landscape in which the entire financial system is operating. Supply chains are being re-wired. Uncertainty has become a constant feature of the global economy. Businesses, small and large, are reluctant to hire or invest given this uncertainty; for example, we can’t ignore a growing risk: higher youth unemployment. Across Canada, many young people are struggling to gain their footing in the workforce. AI-related developments certainly played a role in that. Unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds has persistently remained high, reaching close to nine per cent in September, the highest since 2010, excluding the peak COVID period. These young people are starting their financial journeys already at a disadvantage compared to their parents’ generation. Combined with the high cost of living and inflationary pressures that we are facing, Gen Z is more likely to have a cautious outlook and mindset to saving and spending. This creates a compounding challenge for pension plans: fewer young workers contributing, those who do contribute may be saving less due to financial constraints, and the gap between contributors and beneficiaries continues to widen. This reality underscores why we need a resilient pension system now more than ever. While we cannot control macroeconomic trends, we can ensure that the pension system is positioned to weather these demographic pressures and continue serving Canadians through uncertain times. That means rigorous oversight, proactive risk management, and ensuring plan administrators are prepared for a future that may look different from the past. BCFSA and B.C. Pension Plans BCFSA understands the important role that resilient pension plans play in many Canadians’ long-term retirement goals. You may have seen our latest Report on Pension Plans Registered in B.C. that went out last week. The data showed that overall, B.C. pension plans are well funded, having shown resiliency in navigating the past several years’ economic challenges, including existing and emerging risks. At the end of 2024, there were approximately 1.3 million Pension Plan members here in B.C. There are 610 pension plans managing $237.6 billion in assets, although the bulk of these assets is concentrated in a few of the larger and more complex plans. In fact, seven out of the 610 plans make up 64 per cent of total plan membership and 81 per cent of total plan assets. Also, trade uncertainties are imposing difficulties on some pension plan sponsors in certain industries, for example, in the forest industry. This impacts the sponsor’s ability or willingness to fund pension plans. Given that backdrop, it is a strong outcome for the sector that as of our most recent projections, at June 30, 2025, estimated going-concern and solvency funded levels for benefit formula plans showed strong results. In aggregate: The median going-concern funded ratio: 139 per cent The median solvency funded ratio: 126 per cent These numbers reflect both defined benefit and target benefit plans, which together represent over 90 per cent of plan members in B.C. This means that the majority of",

      "content": "News If You Do Business in New Brunswick, It’s Time to Report Unclaimed Property SAINT JOHN – The annual reporting period under New Brunswick’s Unclaimed Property Act is now open. Businesses and organizations holding unclaimed funds have until March 31, 2026, to report these funds to New Brunswick’s Unclaimed Property (UP) Program at FundsFinderNB.ca . Administered by the Financial and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick (The Commission), the program is now in its fourth year. “At the end of last year’s reporting period, 333 unique businesses had reported more than $41.1 million in unclaimed property since the program’s launch,” said Marissa Sollows, the Commission’s Director of Communications and Public Affairs. “These are funds that can now be reunited with their rightful owners.” Unclaimed property refers to money and other monetary property held by businesses and other entities that has been forgotten or abandoned by its owners. Uncashed cheques, security deposits and customer overpayments are common examples of unclaimed property that holders might possess. “Since launching the FundsFinderNB.ca website, we’ve reunited New Brunswickers with $3.3 million in forgotten funds,” Sollows said. “To continue this success, we rely on businesses to report any unclaimed property on their books. Every year, more money becomes unclaimed, and it’s vital that businesses understand their responsibilities under the law.” To support businesses, the Commission has launched awareness campaigns and provided resources at FundsFinderNB.ca , including step-by-step guides, FAQs and templates to help organizations comply with their reporting obligations. Money and monetary property are generally considered unclaimed when there has been no activity for at least three years, or 10 years for credit union accounts. If the apparent owner does not respond to contact efforts from the business, the property must then be reported to the Unclaimed Property Program. Businesses are encouraged to work with their lawyers or accountants to understand what to look for when reviewing their books.

      "content": "Alerts Fraud alert: Fake “Carleton Credit Union” scam targeting investors The Financial and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick is warning New Brunswickers about a scam using phony websites for a fake credit union in Centreville, NB. Scammers are cold calling people claiming to represent the “Carleton Credit Union,” which they allege is based in Centreville, NB and are soliciting investments. No such credit union is registered with the Commission and an entity using that business name is not registered to deal or advise in securities or derivatives in New Brunswick. During the calls, the scammers point to fake websites designed to lend legitimacy to their investment offers. Three websites have been discovered to date using variations of the fake credit union name: carletoncn.com carltoncreunion.com carltonpioneercru.ca All three list the address of the “Carleton Credit Union” at 3143 Main St., Centreville, NB – this is the actual address of the Brunswick Credit Union, a legitimate registered credit union in New Brunswick. The Commission has notified the Brunswick Credit Union of the scam. How to protect yourself Never provide personal, credit card or banking details in response to unsolicited phone calls or messages, and do not enter those details on any website if you are not certain the site is genuine. Before making any investment, give yourself permission to pause and ensure the person or entity is licensed or registered with the Commission. It does not matter if the person or entity is based in the province or not. If they do business in New Brunswick, they must be licensed or registered with the Commission. This applies whether the business is done in person, in writing, online or over the phone. For credit unions operating in New Brunswick, the Commission provides corporate registry services. A list of incorporated credit unions in New Brunswick can be found here . To check if an individual or firm is registered to deal or advise in securities or derivatives in New Brunswick, use the National Registration Search tool. Don’t rush a decision or be pressured to invest your money. Seek the advice of a registered financial professional. Anyone who suspects they may have been a victim of this fraud should report it to the Commission by calling 1-866-933-2222, emailing info@fcnb.ca , or online by visiting fcnb.ca .",

Background Concerned about the wide array of titles used by individuals in New Brunswick’s financial marketplace, the New Brunswick government mandated the Commission in 2021 to develop a title protection regime for the province. Following a public consultation with industry stakeholders and consumer and investor advocates in August 2021, the Commission proposed legislation to the province in May 2022. The Act received Royal Assent on June 16, 2023, and two proposed rules to support the title protection framework were published in January 2024 for a 90-day comment period. The two rules were approved by the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board on November 7, 2025 and the Act was proclaimed on January 1, 2026. Media Contact: 1 866 933-2222 or media@fcnb.ca .

      "content": "Contempt charges against Bermudian head of London Pride Sékou Hendrickson Created: Jan 15, 2026 07:58 AM (Updated: Jan 15, 2026 03:48 PM) Christopher Joell-Deshields, the suspended CEO of Pride in London (File photograph) A Bermudian living in England is under fire for allegedly slowing an investigation into accusations of bullying and misappropriating funds for an LGBTQ+ group. The BBC reported on Tuesday that Christopher Joell-Deshields appeared in the London High Court, accused of contempt of court during an investigation into his time as head of Pride in London. Mr Joell-Deshields was accused of spending £7,000 (about $9,400) worth of vouchers donated by sponsors on luxury perfumes and Apple tech products. Volunteers also accused him of creating a “toxic” work culture at the organisation, which included sending bullying messages to a disabled volunteer over WhatsApp. He was suspended as chief executive of Pride in London, one Britain’s largest and longest-running LGBTQ+ Pride parades, and removed as its director after a leave of absence at the end of August 2025. The court heard that Mr Joell-Deshields was ordered to hand over company devices, as well as access to bank accounts and social-media profiles, while the disciplinary investigation continued. However, lawyers for the organisation claimed he failed to adhere to this order and accused him of two counts of contempt of court. Mr Joell-Deshields pleaded not guilty to failing to hand over the accounts, but admitted failing to submit a statement confirming that he had complied with the order. John Brown, for the defence, explained that his client denied failing to return all necessary information and equipment, but accepted not providing a witness statement verifying that he returned the property. Asked about a laptop that had not been returned, Dr Brown said: “His case is that though the laptop was purchased by the company, it was purchased to replace his laptop that was damaged at work.” Deputy judge Tim Maloney said a trial for the remaining charge would proceed on the first available date after February 10. The hearing will address what sanctions Mr Joell-Deshields could face for not providing a witness statement and hear arguments from Pride in London’s lawyers regarding the first contempt charge. If convicted, the result could be imprisonment, fines or assets being seized, according to the BBC. The investigation into Mr Joell-Deshields, the broadcaster reported, has reached its seventh month, during which time he received an £85,000 annual salary while under suspension — equivalent to about $115,000. Mr Joell-Deshields was made CEO of Pride in London in 2021, and the position has been taken up in the interim by Rebecca Paisis since September 2025. The organisation uses more than 100 year-round volunteers and several paid staff members. Mr Joell-Deshields’s roles in England included working as the assistant director and office manager of the Bermuda Government Office in London in 2009. He previously served as a business development manager for the former Bermuda Department of Tourism’s London office after a lengthy career in the hospitality industry in Britain. Ms Paisis wrote in a statement on Pride in London’s website : “The London LGBT Community Pride CIC (LLCP), which holds the licence to deliver Pride in London, has been engaged in a complex process to regain control of key organisational systems from Christopher Joell-Deshields, who has been on a leave of absence since the 29th of August. “Regaining control of these systems has unfortunately been a long and protracted exercise, including obtaining a mandatory injunction granted by a High Court judge against Mr Joell-Deshields on September 12, requiring the return of control of operational systems and bank accounts to the organisation. “The board has also been taking necessary steps to independently investigate a number of allegations raised to the board of directors against Mr Joell-Deshields. “At present, the board is not in a position to comment further until the matter is concluded. “However, I would like to thank all our community, volunteers, partners and stakeholders for their unwavering support, patience and trust as we navigate this period.” Mr Joell-Deshields has no association with OutBermuda beyond successfully suggesting a theme for the 2023 Bermuda Pride celebrations. • It is The Royal Gazette’s policy not to allow comments on stories regarding court cases.

      "content": "Business Newsday Yesterday An Airbus A321-131 jet. - Several years ago, a very successful local entrepreneur decided to start up an airline and incorporated a local company for that purpose. An application was made to the Civil Aviation Authority for an air operators certificate (AOC) which is the approval to engage in commercial air transport operations. This is done in accordance with a five-phase certification process in accordance with the policy guidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The prospective operator (“the lessee”) proceed to dry lease a used jet aircraft from a US leasing company (“the lessor”) to conduct the air transport operations. A dry lease is an agreement in which an airline leases an aircraft without any crew, maintenance, or insurance. The lessee is responsible for providing its own crew, maintenance, and insurance. This type of lease is typically used when an airline needs to expand its fleet for a longer period such as when it is entering a new market or launching a new route. Dry leases are usually long-term agreements, ranging from three to twelve years. Midway during the certification process, the entrepreneur withdrew the application for the AOC and decided to return the aircraft to the lessor. All aircraft lease agreements specify the “Return Conditions” for the aircraft to the lessor. The lessee has a legal obligation to meet all the return conditions to the satisfaction of the lessor. In this situation, one of the return conditions was that “the aircraft must qualify for a US 14 CFR Part 121 Certificate.” This required the aircraft to comply with all mandatory modifications and inspections in accordance with a continuous airworthiness maintenance programme (CAMP) ensuring all aircraft remain airworthy through regular, documented inspections and repairs. By that time, the aircraft had attained the threshold based on calendar time, flying hours and cycles for compliance with the FAA approved mandatory Supplemental Structural Inspection Programme (SSIP). The lessee has to expend millions of dollars to comply with the SSIP. In the process, the lessee had to sell his lucrative business and personal real estate to fund the return conditions. - In reviewing the lease agreement before execution, the lessee and his attorneys did not understand the meaning of “the aircraft must qualify for a US 14 CFR Part 121 Certificate.” On another occasion while employed at BWIA with responsibility for aircraft acquisition, I was sent to the Orlando, Florida to take delivery of a used MD83 twinjet aircraft for which a duly executed leased agreement was in place. In doing the acceptance checks, an engine was found to be marginally meeting the performance requirements for full takeoff power. Additionally, there were some minor structural issues. Based on these two conditions, I refused acceptance of the aircraft and insisted that the lessor change the engine and rectify the structural issues. The lessor’s engineer on site refused to take any corrective action and a standoff ensued and I continued to refuse acceptance. This went for about a week until one of the lessor’s senior attorneys arrived in Orlando and showed me a copy of the full lease agreement which stated that BWIA had agreed to lease the aircraft in an “as is, where is” condition. I was seeing this for the first time and the BWIA legal department, when contacted confirmed the an “as is, where is” condition. BWIA was contractually obligated to take delivery of the aircraft. During the period 1996/1997, BWIA dry leased two Airbus A321-131 aircraft for a seven year period. A new CEO decided that it was the wrong aircraft type and sought to terminate the lease. However, there were no grounds for the termination of the lease. The agreement provided that the lessee (BWIA), with the approval of the lessor, can sublease the aircraft. If the aircraft is subleased at a lower rate than that prescribed in the substantive lease agreement, the lessee is obligated to pay the difference. The two Airbus A321-131 were subsequently subleased to a Turkish carrier, Air Alpha at a lower rate and BWIA had to pay the difference of US$20,000 per month per aircraft. On December 19, 2011 CAL signed an agreement with lessor AerCap for lease two Boeing 767 -300 ER aircraft for delivery in May 2012 to operate non-stop services between Port of Spain and London Gatwick. The London route was losing approximately US$20 million per year. Consequently, in July 2015, CAL agreed with AerCap for the early redelivery of the two Boeing 767-300 ER aircraft as part of its discontinuation of the London Gatwick route effective January 31, 2016 and termination of the Boeing 767-300 ER operations. This agreement to early redeliver the aircraft included an early termination penalty of US$135,000 per month on each of the two 767 aircraft from the dates of the early redelivery of February 1, 2016 and March 15, 2016 respectively to the original contractual red",

      "content": "Business Newsday Yesterday - When people in Trinidad and Tobago think about migration, the same destinations usually dominate the conversation: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. These routes feel familiar, but they have become increasingly difficult to access. Visa backlogs, tightening immigration rules, rising living costs, and long periods of uncertainty have made migration feel out of reach for many. What is often overlooked is that this difficulty is not universal. Over the last two years, Thailand has modernised its immigration framework, introducing visa options that make it easier for people from the Caribbean — including TT — to live in the country legally for short, medium, or long periods. With cost-of-living pressures reshaping personal and professional decisions, Thailand has emerged as a practical alternative worth serious consideration. The cost-of-living advantage Thailand’s strongest attraction is affordability, especially for professionals earning in foreign currency or operating online businesses. In major hubs such as Bangkok and Chiang Mai, housing can be significantly cheaper than in TT, while utilities, internet, and mobile services are reliable and low-cost. Food is also manageable, with affordable local options alongside international choices. For households facing higher rents, electricity bills, and grocery prices at home, Thailand’s lower cost structure can create breathing room — enabling people to save more, reduce stress, and reinvest in personal or business growth. Test the lifestyle before committing Long-term migration does not have to start with a long-term visa. TT passport holders can currently enter Thailand visa-free for 60 days, with the option to extend for an additional 30 days inside the country. With short regional trips to nearby countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, or China for border runs, it is possible to spend three to nine months in Thailand while evaluating whether a longer-term move makes sense. Regional travel in Asia is relatively inexpensive, which makes “try-before-you-commit” a realistic strategy rather than an expensive gamble. Family-friendly pathways A major difference between Thailand and traditional Western routes is that several long-stay visas allow applicants to relocate with a spouse and children. This contrasts with the lengthy and costly family reunification processes common in North America and Europe. - As international migration into Thailand has increased, international schools have expanded across major cities, offering British, American, IB, and other globally recognised curricula. For families, this development makes Thailand a viable long-term base rather than a short-term experiment. Key visas to know Thailand’s immigration system offers multiple pathways depending on career stage, income level, and long-term goals. • Destination Thailand Visa (DTV): Designed for digital professionals, freelancers, consultants, creators, and business owners earning income from outside Thailand. It is valid for five years and allows stays of up to 180 days per entry, with extensions available. For remote workers and location-independent business owners, it is one of the most flexible long-stay options. • SMART (Talent) Visa: Aimed at people with specialised, in-demand skills aligned with Thailand’s development priorities. Eligible fields include technology, software development, engineering, robotics, biotechnology, digital platforms, and medical innovation. The SMART Visa can be issued for up to four years and allows qualifying professionals to work in Thailand without a traditional work permit. • Long-Term Resident (LTR) visas: Targeted at high-income professionals, executives, investors, and retirees with substantial assets or pensions. Some categories can be valid for up to 10 years and may offer advantages for long-term stability. • Education visas: Available for individuals enrolled in recognised universities, language schools, or approved training (Muay Thai/Thai cooking programmes). This route can work for people who want to live in Thailand while studying and exploring longer-term options. • Retirement visas: Available for those aged 50 and over, usually requiring proof of savings or pension income and health insurance. These are popular with retirees seeking a lower cost of living and access to quality healthcare. Health and compliance considerations Trinidad and Tobago is classified as a yellow fever–risk country. Travellers must present a valid yellow fever vaccination card every time they enter Thailand. This is strictly enforced and should be treated as essential travel documentation. As with any long-stay plan, visa holders must also comply with local immigration rules and reporting requirements. Understanding these obligations early helps prevent avoidable complications. Rethinking migration choices For decades, migration conversations in Trinidad and Tobago have been narrowly focused on a small number of Weste",

Fuel terminal operator West Indies Petroleum Terminal (WIPT) reported weaker earnings in its first financial release since listing, sending shares down more than 25 per cent. Even so, the stock traded mid-day Thursday at $9.20 – more than 18 times its December debut price of $0.50. The rally has produced eye-catching valuations. On Tuesday, WIP Energy and World Energy Solutions, WIPT’s two largest shareholders, briefly saw their holdings valued at $100 billion and $30 billion, respectively, when the company’s market capitalisation closed trading at $135 billion. Intraday trading on Tuesday pushed the valuation as high as $156 billion before the stock cooled from $14 highs to $12.20. That translated in hard currency to nearly US$1.0 billion for a company that reported equity of US$29.0 million as of September 2025, up from US$27.0 million at year-end 2024, aided by property revaluation gains. “The company continues to diversify its income streams,” WIPT said in its financials. WIPT operates the Port Esquivel terminal, storing petroleum products such as fuel oil, diesel, gasolene, but not natural gas. WIPT operates as the storage and logistics arm of its fuel provider parent West Indies Petroleum. For the third quarter ended September, net profit fell to about US$648,000 from roughly US$868,000 a year earlier.

Quarterly revenue declined 6.0 per cent to US$2.23 million, while year-to-date revenue slipped 3.0 per cent to US$6.5 million, reflecting weaker throughput volumes despite growth in third-party storage contracts. The company added that storage fees from third parties rose to US$2.4 million, or 43 per cent of total storage revenues, compared with US$600,000, or 10 per cent, a year earlier. Throughput revenues from third parties climbed to US$400,000, or 6 per cent of total revenue, versus none in the prior year.

      "content": "Saks, the 164-year-old luxury department store, files for bankruptcy Published: Thursday | January 15, 2026 | 12:09 AM Photo Video Evan Agostini Saks Fifth Avenue holiday light show and window reveal on Monday, November 24, 2025, in New York. The owner of Saks Fifth Avenue is seeking bankruptcy protection, buffeted by rising competition and the massive debt it took on to buy its rival in the luxury sector, Neiman Marcus, just over a year ago. Saks Global has secured roughly US$1.75 billion in financing, the New York company said as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Wednesday in the Southern District of Texas. The private company said that stores will remain open as it restructures company debt, meaning that it will honour the programmes it has for customers. Suppliers and employees will be paid, Saks said. There are about 33 Saks stores and 36 Neiman Marcus locations, according to the company, as well as two Bergdorf Goodman stores and roughly 70 Saks Off 5th discount stores. “This is a defining moment for Saks Global, and the path ahead presents a meaningful opportunity to strengthen the foundation of our business and position it for the future,” said Geoffroy van Raemdonck, who took over for CEO and Executive Chairman Richard Baker this week. Baker had assumed control after the company’s CEO, Marc Metrick, stepped down earlier this month. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters. When Saks said that it would buy Neiman Marcus for US$2.65 billion in the summer of 2024, the goal was to create a powerhouse in a luxury sector that had grown more fragmented. Online sellers were siphoning customers, and big-name brands had begun to sell goods from their own stores. But the tie-up with Neiman Marcus only worsened Saks’ debt situation as luxury sales weakened. Global sales of luxury goods are expected to contract for the second straight year in 2026 as consumers, anxious about the global economy, pare back their spending, according to a study by Bain & Co. consultancy released in November. Hudson’s Bay, Canada’s oldest company, began liquidating all but six of its stores in March 2025. The upscale department store landscape has been volatile in recent years. Neiman Marcus entered bankruptcy protection for about four months in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic spread. The privately held department store chain was forced to close its stores for several months during the pandemic, like other competitors such as Lord & Taylor. Lord & Taylor sought bankruptcy protection in August of that year then said it would close all of its stores and operate as an online retailer only. The century-old department store Nordstrom agreed to be taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group in a US$6.25 billion deal last year. Sales at the long-suffering Macy’s have begun to improve under new CEO Tony Spring, who has shuttered unprofitable stores and improved service. He is also trying to attract the same luxury shoppers who power sales at Bloomingdale’s and upscale beauty retailer Bluemercury, which are both owned by Macy’s. There is concern among vendors about Saks and how things will move forward. “They’re very nervous, very concerned, very worried about spring deliveries for merchandise that they’ve already produced,” said Gary Wassner, CEO of Hilldun Corp., which ensures that suppliers get paid for products shipped to retailers. “They weren’t able to complete deliveries on what they had produced for the fourth quarter of 2025, so they’re sitting with that inventory.” Wassner said Saks Global accounted for 40 to 50 per cent of the business of some of his clients. He said that he told his clients to stop shipping to Saks last month given the uncertainty. Wassner said that his clients have US$130 million in spring orders waiting to be delivered to Saks. They are seeking guarantees of payment from Hilldun before shipping. Saks said that it has financing commitments of US$1.5 billion from some of its creditors and another US$240 million in “incremental liquidity” from its lenders.

(Photo: CMC) Latest News , Regional January 16, 2026 Antigua to recruit nurses from Ghana, insists it has not ended programme with Cuba ST JOHN’S, Antigua (CMC) — The Government of Antigua and Barbuda has agreed to contract over 100 nurses from Ghana, but insisted that it has not formally ended the programme where it recruits health professionals from Cuba to work within the country’s healthcare system. The United States (US) has stepped up its call for Caribbean countries to end the health programme with Cuba, saying Washington “stands with those affected and continues to work for an end to the Cuban regime’s exploitative labour practices”. A statement issued following the weekly Cabinet meeting said the Government welcomes “the arrival of 120 nurses from the Republic of Ghana expected over the weekend of January 23, 2026, who will serve within the public healthcare system of Antigua and Barbuda”. “Minister of Health, Sir Molwyn Joseph, announced that these nurses will be deployed primarily at the Sir Lester Bird Medical Centre, as well as within community health clinics and schools, thereby enhancing both hospital-based and community-level healthcare delivery,” the Cabinet statement added. Director-General of Communications, Maurice Merchant, later told reporters that the Cabinet reaffirmed its commitment to the strengthening and long-term sustainability of Antigua and Barbuda’s national health system, noting the Government’s continued focus on expanding and stabilising the healthcare workforce. He said that the expanded cadre of health professionals is expected to significantly improve service delivery and reduce pressure on existing staff within the public health system. Merchant said that Antigua and Barbuda nurses are generally highly-trained and like nurses from other Caribbean territories, are wooed by health institutions in North America and Europe with promises of higher pay and greater benefits that the country cannot match. While pointing to the need to recruit nurses from elsewhere to help booster the healthcare system, Merchant said the Government has also placed much emphasis on the training of additional nursing personnel, noting that scholarships were offered in the last academic year to 15 nurses to pursue master’s degrees at the West Indies Five Islands Campus (UWI FIC). Meanwhile, Merchant insists that the Gaston Browne government has not formally ended the programme where it recruits health professionals from Cuba to work within the country’s healthcare system. He told reporters that the Cuban health professionals have been a mainstay of the local healthcare system for many years and as with all relationships, the arrangement is currently going through a period of transition. “There have been speculations and statements erroneously being made in the public by politicians and individuals who just simply want to ‘muddy the waters’ between the Republic of Cuba and the United States. “It is unfortunate that this is being done. The Government values the contributions that have been made and are being made by the Cuban government with regards to our health sector and as with everything, there is a period of transition,” Merchant said. He told reporters that the goal of the Government is for Antigua and Barbuda to be self-sufficient with regards to the provision of nurses in the country’s healthcare system and that is why the Government has focused much energy on the training of local nurses in collaboration with the University of the West Indies FIC. Earlier this week, the United States, which has condemned the Cuban Health Brigade programme and has urged regional countries to end the relationship, noted that “the corrupt Cuban regime is profiting off the forced labour of medical personnel”. “Renting out Cuban medical professionals at exorbitant prices and keeping the profit for regime elites is not a humanitarian gift. It is forced labour. It treats the doctors as commodities rather than human beings and professionals,” according to a statement posted on the website of the US Embassy in Barbados. “The United States calls for an end to the Cuban regime’s coercive and exploitative labour export scheme,” the statement said, adding, “Did you know? Across the Caribbean, nations pay the Cuban government high fees to rent medical professionals—often more than they pay their own local doctors.” “This programme is not a gift from Cuba to the people of the Caribbean; it is an overpriced arrangement funded by local taxpayers. Money is often paid directly to the corrupt Cuban regime, which takes 80-95 per cent of the doctors’ salaries. This is a modern-day forced labour scheme. It comes at a high cost to participating countries, not only financially, but also in terms of basic human dignity and morality. “The United States stands with those affected and continues to work for an end to the Cuban regime’s exploitative labour practices,” the statement a",

(Photo: Karl Mclarty) News Alicia Dunkley-Willis | Senior Reporter January 16, 2026 For the needy, not the greedy Gov’t vows clear tracking, accountability in multi-billion-dollar hurricane aid programme The Government on Thursday launched its multi-billion-dollar Hurricane Melissa Shelter Recovery Programme (SRP) promising accountability through traceability and warning that, based on lessons learnt from Hurricane Beryl in 2024, it will be able to spot individuals who try to dupe the system to collect multiple benefits. The SRP is a multifaceted, coordinated national response covering reconstruction, rehabilitation, and relocation and marks the Government’s transition from relief to recovery after Hurricane Melissa which hit Jamaica on October 28 last year. Led by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, SRP is designed to support families, restore homes, and strengthen communities. “In terms of the delivery we will be utilising a suite of payment modalities to advance the delivery of disbursements that will allow us to accommodate the many different circumstances that persons are existing in,” Labour and Social Security Minister Pearnel Charles Jr said, noting that the funds will be leveraging digital delivery which will allow the Government to ringfence and have better management of where vouchers are used to ensure accountability. “With the SRP, what we have done is to develop some principles and protocols that will guide how we execute and to make sure that everything we do is clear and accountable. There will be one benefit per household, and this is from the lessons learnt in Beryl, where we had some persons who might have been partners for life and utilised the functionality of their different last names in a very good way. We’ve learnt a lot of lessons in terms of our social workers going out and doing certain investigations,” Charles Jr added pointedly while providing an overview of the programme during the launch at Jamaica House in St Andrew. He said steps have been put in place to eliminate duplication using the Taxpayer Registration Number (TRN) system, and other means. In the meantime, he warned Jamaicans to be on the alert for unscrupulous individuals who might attempt to capitalise on their suffering. “There is no fee associated with the process of application for the SRP. Artificial intelligence is being utilised by all, and so already we have had to cauterise and eliminate from the public domain persons who have sought to give the impression that they are associated with the ministry or the Government of Jamaica, and asking people for information. I want to reiterate that there is no fee and that you should utilise authentic Government channels of information because we have found that they target the same persons we are targeting: the vulnerable. Our social workers are alert to make sure they can identify the persons trying to destroy our prosperity,” he added. Charles Jr said, to date, more than 70,000 household assessments have been completed covering more than 200,000 people, which will determine the grant payments for households that experienced minor damage, major damage, or severe damage. So far, he said, 18 per cent of homes assessed have seen severe damage; 40 per cent, major damage; and 42 per cent, minor damage. The major component of the programme is the Restoration of Owner-Occupant Family Shelter (ROOFS) segment which allows the ministry to satisfy the passage of benefits to individuals assessed for damage. The grants tiered at $75,000, $200,000, and $500,000 will be allocated based on the category of damage and are sourced from“an initial $10-billion allocation by the Government”, and should begin flowing by the end of this month. “To be eligible for the programme, once you are on the beneficiary list, meaning once you have been impacted by the hurricane, you have done the assessment and you have been verified, you are automatically qualified,” the labour minister explained. “If we go to your street and we don’t see you, we cannot complete the assessment, so we have a self-reporting tool that you can also access, not for you to qualify, but for you to be assessed and then verified and you would qualify,” he said further. “So, if you don’t have any damage, you are not going to be a part of ROOFS, if you have minor, major, severe damage you are part of ROOFS…” Charles Jr explained. The programme also carries a Government-led repair component which is being driven by the Jamaica Defence Force with a focus on roof repairs, a partner-led repair aspect led by the humanitarian assistance community, and a National Housing Trust-led component which features grants, loans, insurance and modular solutions deployed through the State’s So",
