      "content": "Today, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) had its first Quarterly Release of 2026. As part of this release, OSFI has finalized new liquidity guidance and is launching consultations on credit risk management as well as accountability for boards and senior leaders. This Quarterly Release highlights how OSFI's focused policy efforts and smart oversight are engaging industry on risk issues that are the most critical and have greatest impact. Concentrating resources where they matter most ensures institutions can adapt and grow while preserving confidence and stability. Specific details include: OSFI is consolidating existing credit risk management guidance for mortgage lending, commercial real estate, and corporate lending into a single, principle-based guideline. A six-month consultation will seek feedback on overarching principles and key content areas. The resulting Credit Risk Management Guideline will align with international best practices and improve regulatory and supervisory efficiency, while reducing complexity and compliance burden for institutions. OSFI will start a nine-month consultation focused on the issues of governance and accountability for boards and senior leaders . Governance and accountability risks can weaken financial institution resilience — when these risks materialize, they often appear as a systemic issue bypassing an institution's early warning system. Strong governance and accountability help institutions stay resilient, manage risk, and maintain public trust. OSFI refined the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline for 2026 to improve consistency in liquidity risk measurement and support institutions' long-term strategic planning. OSFI also provided additional updates: The development of a new guide to its administrative monetary penalties . Following its pilot, OSFI has determined that loan-to-income (LTI) limits lessen the build‑up of highly leveraged residential mortgage borrowers, which in turn reduces systemic risk. Therefore, LTI limits will remain in place. At this time, existing debt service expectations in Guideline B-20 will continue to complement LTI limits. ",

      "content": "Jamaica positioned to benefit from US trade realignment, Wall Street strategist says Published: Sunday | January 25, 2026 | 12:11 AM Photo Video Jamaica can capture investment flows from the US as companies restructure their network of suppliers in response to geopolitical tensions, a Wall Street strategist said. John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, told investors gathered in Kingston on Tuesday that “reglobalisation” – the realignment of trade relationships – presents opportunities for countries near the US as businesses diversify away from politically sensitive regions. “Reglobalisation is very simply likely to be exceptionally beneficial for the emerging markets, especially those that are neighbours of the US in the southern hemisphere,” Stoltzfus said at the Jamaica Stock Exchange Investments and Capital Markets Conference. “It would seem to us that countries like Jamaica, especially well positioned as you are philosophically, and with an encouragement of capitalism and entrepreneurism, we think this is just a terrific opportunity.” He was speaking on the topic ‘Innovative Financial Products Driving Emerging Market Growth ’ at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel in New Kingston on January 21. The remarks came one day after President Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum, expressing his expansionary policy of acquiring the nation of Greenland. Denmark, the protectorate of the country, continues to reject Trump’s posturing. It follows the US capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, arising from a military invasion.

Stoltzfus, who has four decades of experience trading global markets, distinguished between deglobalisation – a retreat from interconnected trade – and reglobalisation, which he described as a restructuring of partnerships based on geopolitical alignment rather than cost alone. He didn’t explicitly mention US-China tensions or tariff barriers driving the shift. He credited technology with expanding both the speed of information and range of investment products available to retail investors. Stoltzfus praised Jamaica’s regulatory framework and entrepreneurial culture as advantages in attracting capital. “I do believe that the fundamentals remain remarkably good in the US and in different countries around the world, including this one,” he said, citing “proper regulation and support of the capital markets” and recognition that “entrepreneurism is very much alive”. luke.douglas@gleanerjm.com «The business behind an autistic Barbie doll Tank-Weld enters solar distribution market » View the discussion thread.",

      "title": "Wage pressures strain budget",
      "url": "https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/2026/01/30/wage-pressures-strain-budget/",
      "date": "2026-01-30",
      "content": "Wage pressures strain budget Fiscal watchdog sounds alarm as Jamaica plans post-hurricane rebuild Jamaica’s fiscal watchdog has warned that rising public sector wage pressures are already straining the budget, complicating the Government’s ability to finance post-hurricane reconstruction. The Independent Fiscal Commission (IFC) said compensation costs exceeded budgeted levels in the first half of the fiscal year and could climb further as unsettled wage negotiations conclude, adding pressure to public finances weakened by the impact of Hurricane Melissa, which slammed into the island on October 28 last year. The warning comes as the Government prepares to outline its post-hurricane reconstruction financing plans, with spending needs expected to rise sharply in the months ahead. “Unsettled public sector wage negotiations could lead to higher-than-budgeted wages and salaries expenditure, thus posing a significant fiscal risk,” the commission said in its January assessment tabled in Parliament on Tuesday. From April to September, compensation of employees totalled $255.1 billion, overshooting the original budget by $3.2 billion, or 1.3 per cent, the IFC said. Wages and salaries alone were $2.3 billion above projections, even before ongoing negotiations are finalised, while employers’ contributions also exceeded estimates. Compensation of employees accounted for nearly half of central government recurrent expenditure during the period, underscoring its significance as one of the least flexible components of the budget. By contrast, capital expenditure — which is more easily deferred — was under-executed by $16.3 billion, or nearly 46 per cent, over the same six-month period, reinforcing concerns that higher wage costs may be accommodated through reduced investment. The IFC noted that Jamaica currently has no active fiscal rule governing wages and salaries and said the Government has given no commitment to reintroducing such a rule, despite repeated recommendations. Following the rebasing of national accounts in 2025, the wage bill stood at about 12.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), lower than earlier estimates, but still elevated by regional and historical standards, according to the commission. The watchdog said the absence of a formal public sector compensation negotiation cycle has contributed to fiscal uncertainty, as wage settlements are often concluded outside the annual budget process, forcing governments to revise spending plans after they have already been approved by Parliament. Section 48H of the Financial Administration and Audit Act provides for the establishment of a structured compensation negotiation cycle aligned with budget preparation. The IFC reiterated that implementing such a framework would improve predictability and reduce fiscal risk. The warning comes as Jamaica faces elevated spending needs after Hurricane Melissa caused an estimated US$8.8 billion in damage. The Government has temporarily suspended fiscal rules under disaster escape clauses and is seeking a two-year extension to its legislated debt-to-GDP target, with public debt projected to rise to 68.2 per cent of GDP by year-end, from 60.3 per cent in September. While acknowledging the exceptional shock, the commission said suspending fiscal rules does not remove the need for credible medium-term adjustment plans as the country moves into a reconstruction phase. {\"xml\":\"xml\"} {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"}",

      "content": "Blake Wolfe Older Canadians’ retirement confidence is dropping amid longer life expectancies and a rising percentage of employees who continue to work past age 65, according to a new survey by the National Institute on Ageing at Toronto Metropolitan University. The survey, which polled more than 6,000 Canadians aged 50 and older, found one in five (22 per cent) said they’ve saved $5,000 or less for retirement. A similar percentage reported having between $5,000 and $100,000 (26 per cent) and between $100,000 and $500,000 (24 per cent). Read: Survey finds confidence key to higher retirement savings “It’s really concerning when we know people are living longer — some of these individuals might be looking at a 40-year retirement on less than $100,000,” says Talia Bronstein, the NIA’s director of policy. “We’re also looking at a greater reliance on our publicly-supported income systems like old-age security and the guaranteed income supplement. “It’s concerning for a number of reasons, not only for the well-being of those individuals and their ability to afford food and shelter and all of those important things, but also that strain on public systems.” Indeed, the survey found more than a third (35 per cent) of Canadians aged 50 and older said they were working, while 52 per cent said they were retired. While employment rates were highest among Canadians aged 50 to 64 (58 per cent), nearly a fifth (15 per cent) of those aged 65 to 79 and four per cent of Canadians aged 80 and older said they’re still working. Among Canadians aged 50 and older who haven’t yet retired, the percentage of those who feel they can afford to retire at their desired time has declined from 35 per cent in 2022 to 29 per cent in 2025. Over the same period, those who said they can’t afford to retire at their desired time rose from 37 per cent to 43 per cent, while roughly a quarter said they remain unsure. Read: Six employees discuss their personal roads to retirement The survey’s findings support the need for employers to provide robust retirement savings vehicles to support workers’ financial wellness, says Bronstein. In addition to providing group retirement plans, employers can also support older employees by adjusting terms of employment to meet individual needs. “It might be in terms of accessibility [or] more flexibility — some people might be looking for reduced hours, but they want to remain working so the more flexibility that employers can provide these employees can really be beneficial.” Changes to government policy and legislation around retirement, particularly Canada and Quebec Pension Plan benefits, can also support Canadian workers who are facing uncertainty in retirement. The NIA recently petitioned the federal Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Jobs and Families with a letter advocating for a pension delay guarantee. Read: OAS increase an opportunity for employees to consider delaying retirement: expert Bronstein explains this guarantee would support Canadians who delay taking CPP/QPP benefits by reimbursing, in the event of early death, their estate with the difference between the benefits they actually received and what would’ve been received had benefits been claimed at age 60. In 2020, the NIA published a report that found the average Canadian taking CPP/QPP benefits at age 60 instead of waiting until age 70 can expect to lose more than $100,000 of secure lifetime income. “It’s a safety net and [the pension delay guarantee] addresses Canadians’ No. 1 fear of delaying CPP/QPP benefits, which is the fear of missing out. It’s not a financial calculus issue that people are having — it’s actually a psychological one. It’s a really exciting opportunity to nudge people in the direction of delaying claiming their CPP/QPP benefits [and] it’s a really powerful thing the government can do with low cost.” Read: Survey finds Canadian employees delaying retirement due to rising cost of living",

      "content": "Bryan McGovern The Pension Investment Association of Canada will monitor the ongoing progress of several policies related to environmental and sustainability solutions. Last year’s federal budget indicated greenwashing provisions would be coming to the Competition Act at a time when the pension association has advocated for clear and flexible environmental, social and governance reporting guidelines, which would help prevent greenwashing and greenhushing tactics, said Asif Haque, chair of the board at PIAC and the chief investment officer at the CAAT Pension Plan, in an emailed statement to Benefits Canada . Read: PIAC urging CSA to resume work on climate disclosure mandate Similarly, the association wants to see the government establish a globally-aligned climate-related financial disclosure rule set to help streamline climate consideration in institutional investment decision-making. The rule would be essential in developing Canada’s economic edge, he said, noting it could also improve durability amid the financial, economic and societal costs of climate change. The feds are moving ahead with a Canadian made sustainable investment guideline and Haque said PIAC will monitor its progress throughout the year. “Taxonomy development plays a crucial role in the net-zero transition by guiding and mobilizing green and transition capital.” It will also continue to push for the reinstatement of a real return bonds program in Canada’s fixed income market. Last year’s budget failed to address whether the asset would make a comeback, but Haque said a return would restore a critical tool for managing inflation risk and strengthen Canada’s investment landscape. Read: Quebec introducing VPLA regulatory framework Continuing one of its trends from last year, PIAC will continue to monitor the harmonization of the regulatory framework for variable payment life annuities, which Haque said provides “a much-needed decumulation solution for defined contribution plans, addressing a gap in retirement planning that was once overlooked.” It’s also advocating for the implementation of a single going-concern plus funding framework. A shift away from dual funding regime in favour of a unified funding framework would strengthen the long-term sustainability of defined benefit pension plans, he said. In 2026, the organization will also monitor ongoing challenges from geopolitical uncertainty, which is increasing market volatility and regulatory risk across key markets. Long-term risk assessment is more complicated in an environment with “trade tensions and shifting alliances,” he added. Read: PIAC, ACPM asking federal government to bring back real return bonds Global institutional investors are facing uncertainty from increasing international policy divergence, which is also complicating ESG and stewardship efforts for pension plans and external managers, according to Haque. This challenge is particularly seen through recent rollbacks of shareholder rights and corporate governance standards in the U.S., he said. For the association, 2025 was defined by growth in reach and services to members, and through a new strategic plan it will continue building on its influence and effectiveness. Haque said 2025 was a year of increased deployment of pension plan capital in the domestic market for PIAC members. “Without compromising our members’ fiduciary duty to pension plan beneficiaries, government can create the necessary conditions for increased domestic investment. Importantly, our members can offer government valuable insights into strategies for enhancing this investment opportunity.” Read: Unified ‘going-concern plus’ regime, reinstating real return bonds among PIAC’s 2025 priorities",

      "content": "Blake Wolfe In 2026, the Canadian Institute of Actuaries will continue to focus on the impact of climate risk on several areas, including pension investments, says Angelita Graham, a partner at Mercer Canada and president of the CIA. Last year, the organization began working with Université du Québec à Montréal for its research chair in actuarial and climate sciences, an initiative designed to improve understanding of the financial impacts of climate change and to help society adapt. Read: Quebec adopts VPLA legislation “It’s an area that’s really going to support public policy decision around some of the climate risk that’s happening [and will] provide actuaries with the tools in terms of risk modeling and analyzing climate change. . . . It’s obviously going to impact the liability side as well as the investment side of things.” The CIA will also continue its work on how variable payment life annuities will impact actuaries, as more jurisdictions adopt legislation around VPLAs. In December, Quebec formally adopted legislation that allows plan sponsors offer the option, including conditions related to plan design, valuation and administration. In November, Ontario announced it’s developing a legislative framework that would permit VPLAs to be offered from pooled registered pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and pension plans that provide for additional voluntary contributions. Read: Ontario taking steps to end preferred pharmacy networks, introducing VPLA framework Similarly, the organization continues to monitor developments in target-benefit pension legislation, such as in Ontario. This year, the organization will also publish an updated mortality table following research into the impact of gender identity on longevity risk. The growth of artificial intelligence is also on the CIA’s radar in 2026 and beyond, says Graham. “Like everyone else, we’re trying to navigate [AI] and as we think about the future, it’s really about making sure we continue to be fit for purpose and that we are giving our actuaries the tools required to be able to function in this rapidly changing world.” Read: What’s the impact of gender identity in determining longevity risk?",

      "content": "Sonya Singh As pension regulators narrow their priorities heading into 2026, the Association of Canadian Pension Management is placing greater emphasis on flexible pension plan design, with a focus on member outcomes, governance and clarity. Korinne Collins, chief executive officer at the ACPM, notes flexibility across the accumulation and decumulation stages is rising on the industry’s agenda as governments and regulators focus on fewer higher-impact issues. Read: ACPM focusing on flexible pension models, CAPSA guidelines in 2025 “I think it’s getting higher on the list,” Collins notes, pointing to recent federal shifts. “It’s focusing on what really matters.” Regulators also appear to be taking a more streamlined approach, concentrating on areas where guidance and supervision can have the greatest impact. “Maybe fewer, but more important things to focus on, or where they want to add some guidance.” That approach aligns with the updated capital accumulation plan and risk management guidance from the Canadian Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities , which plan sponsors implemented on Jan. 1. While ACPM members continue working toward alignment, the guidance focuses less on day-to-day operations and more on longer-term planning. Read: More clarity, flexibility needed in solvency reserve accounts for federally regulated DB pension plans: ACPM “We’re not seeing a significant shift in operational activity. The focus is on preparing for future risks rather than managing funds differently on a daily basis.” Collins points to an opportunity for pension plans to take a broader view of members across their career and into retirement, as the conversation increasingly moves beyond accumulation. “For a long time, plans have focused on saving. What’s becoming more important is what options are available to members as they move beyond accumulation.” Collaboration among plan sponsors and more consistent communication also remain important, given the complexity of pension plans. “The more we’re seeing the same sorts of things, the clearer it is for members and the average consumer.” Read: How CAPSA’s updated CAP guideline will impact plan sponsors, members Looking ahead, plans that understand their member segments and how needs evolve over time will be better positioned, with the industry continuing to learn collectively. “There’s a lot of talent and passion in the pension industry; everyone is focused on how important strong retirement income is for members.”",

      "content": "Global pension funds are leaning harder into private markets, chasing diversification, illiquidity premia and private credit to boost long-term outcomes. Aviva Investors’ latest Private Markets Study revealed average allocations to private markets have climbed to 12.5 percent of institutional portfolios globally, the highest level in the survey’s eight-year history, based on responses from 500 investors overseeing US$6.5tn in assets across the UK and Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific. North American investors lead with a 14.4 percent allocation, compared with 12.1 percent in Europe and 11.9 percent in Asia-Pacific, and posted the largest year-over-year increase, nearly 2 percentage points from 12.5 percent. Aviva Investors reports that 88 percent of respondents plan to increase (49 percent) or maintain (39 percent) their private markets exposure over the next two years, while 76 percent expect private markets to outperform public markets over the next five years, up from 73 percent in the previous study. Diversification and illiquidity premia sit at the core of that shift. 76 percent of investors point to “diversification of risk and returns” as a primary reason to allocate to private markets, and 55 percent highlight “the presence of an illiquidity premium,” up sharply from 25 percent in 2023. The firm’s quarterly “Illiquidity premia in private debt” research, which has analysed more than 2,100 private debt deals over more than 28 years, most recently found that illiquidity premia in private debt remain above long-term averages. David Hedalen, head of Private Markets Strategy & Research at Aviva Investors, said this year’s study highlights “the increasing importance of illiquidity premia” in private markets and that more confidence in “this reward for having increased illiquidity in portfolios” should reassure investors that such assets “can generate improved returns over the long run.” For return expectations, private equity (51 percent) and infrastructure equity (46 percent) top the list of asset classes investors expect to deliver the strongest risk-adjusted returns over the next five years. North American and European respondents rank private corporate debt third (31 percent and 34 percent), while Asia-Pacific investors choose real estate equity (32 percent). In current allocations, real estate equity remains the largest private markets exposure globally at 22 percent of total private markets holdings, with private equity at 21.5 percent (up from 18.8 percent in 2024) and private corporate debt at 12.5 percent (up from 10.3 percent). Hedalen said real estate equity “remains the dominant destination” for institutional capital and that recent shifts look more like “considered rebalancing” after the 2024 correction than a wholesale rethink of the sector. Defined contribution plans now account for 59 percent of total pension assets across the seven largest markets, according to the Global Pensions Asset Study 2025 by the Thinking Ahead Institute and WTW, cited in the Aviva Investors release.  Within that DC segment, 72 percent of funds globally agree that adding private markets to accumulation portfolios will deliver better performance outcomes for members, with European investors the most supportive at 73 percent. When DC funds assess private markets, 59 percent say they want more emphasis on long-term value and less on cost. Only 13 percent of North American DC funds agree that private markets allocations should support economic growth in their home country, versus a global average of 41 percent, 52 percent in Europe and 41 percent in Asia-Pacific. Where DC funds have already folded private markets into default options, real estate (59 percent), private debt (48 percent) and private equity (43 percent) are the most commonly used asset classes. Wit in private debt, investors in all three regions see asset-backed lending (49 percent), and opportunistic and distressed debt (48 percent), as the sub-asset classes with the most attractive risk-adjusted return potential over the next two years. Hedalen called the evolution of private credit a structural change, saying it is “no longer a substitute for bank lending, but instead is a specialised and differentiated asset class.”  He added that they “see a strong case for strategies such as multi-sector private credit…which can pivot across sectors and capital structures as relative value shifts.” Access preferences are shifting alongside allocations. 58 percent of respondents now favour single-asset-class pooled funds, up from 40 percent last year.  Co-investment has moved into the mainstream, with 54 percent naming it their preferred access route, up from 35 percent, while multi-asset pooled funds are cited by 50 percent, slightly higher than 46 percent a year earlier. Among larger institutions, co-investment demand has jumped. The study reports that 59 percent of investors with $10bn to $20bn in assets under management and 57 percent of those with $20bn or more prefer co-investment, compared with 25 percent and 38 percent, respectively, in last year’s survey.  For these investors, the main attractions are access to larger deals (55 percent), cost reductions (47 percent) and access to high-quality assets (41 percent). Evergreen funds also resonate with many respondents: 79 percent of global investors see flexibility on contributions and withdrawals, and the absence of a fixed lifespan or exit deadline, as the key benefits, while only 30 percent point to more frequent valuations as a major advantage. Hedalen said that “pooled funds remain the most popular access route,” but that their findings also show “a marked increase in appetite for co-investment opportunities from institutional investors of all sizes.”  He said this trend reflects a desire for “greater control of portfolios at an asset-specific level” and more tailored approaches to risk, return, liabilities and other non-financial outcomes, including regional preferences.
