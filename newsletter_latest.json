      "content": "The Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA) is strengthening its oversight of the Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance sector through the establishment of a dedicated P&C Division. The Division’s initial focus will be on market conduct and ultimately be consolidated with prudential regulation of Ontario-incorporated insurance companies. The new division is designed to enhance sector focus, coordination, and accountability, and to further strengthen FSRA’s ability to identify and respond to emerging market risks, while maintaining continuity in regulatory supervision and expectations for industry. Leadership appointments Effective February 1, Jordan Solway, currently Executive Vice President, Legal & Enforcement, will assume the role of Acting Executive Vice President, Property & Casualty. Jordan will lead the accelerated stand-up of the new division, with a targeted go-live date of February 15. Jordan brings deep regulatory and P&C operational experience, along with a strong track record of leading complex, cross-functional work. He was responsible for setting up the Legal & Enforcement function at FSRA and has been instrumental contributing to the development of the principles-based and outcomes focused regulatory approach that has been used across FSRA. To ensure continuity within Legal & Enforcement during this period, Jeff Kehoe has been appointed Interim Executive Vice President, Legal & Enforcement, effective February 1. Jeff brings more than 20 years of experience leading regulatory legal, governance, and enforcement functions, including senior roles at the Ontario Securities Commission and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (now the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization). What this means for industry The creation of the P&C Division does not change regulatory requirements, supervisory expectations, or FSRA’s enforcement posture. Oversight activities will continue uninterrupted. As of February 15, P&C Conduct Supervision, Auto Insurance Supervision (rating and underwriting), and Actuarial Services will align under the new division to support a more integrated approach to P&C oversight. FSRA will continue to share updates as the division becomes operational.",

      "content": "The Jamaica Stock Exchange, where plans for a micro market are taking shape. More than 200 prospective micro and small businesses have been identified, with up to 25 listings possible within two years of launch. Business , Caribbean Business Report (CBR) Karena Bennett | Senior Business Reporter | bennettk@jamaicaobserver.com January 23, 2026 Pathway to Capital Q2 2026 timeline set for dedicated small business stock market Jamaica’s smallest businesses could gain direct access to equity financing as early as the second quarter of 2026, following confirmation from Finance Minister Fayval Williams that work on a dedicated micro market within the Jamaica Stock Exchange is now at an advanced stage. Addressing the Jamaica Stock Exchange’s Regional Investments and Capital Markets Conference at the Jamaica Pegasus hotel on Wednesday, Williams placed a firm timeline on the long-mooted initiative. “I’m expecting the micro market to be up and running by the second quarter of 2026,” she told the audience, adding that the timeline reflects Government expectations as regulatory and technical preparations accelerate. “I’ve taken their timeline, and I’ve put it in the public domain, and we’re going to work with the stock exchange to make sure it happens,” the minister continued. The proposed micro market is being designed as a second tier within the existing Junior Market, allowing earlier-stage businesses to raise equity while relying on the infrastructure, governance standards and regulatory oversight that have underpinned the Junior Market’s success over the past decade. Rather than loosening listing requirements, the approach is intended to extend the capital market’s reach downward in a controlled way, offering micro enterprises a pathway into formal equity financing without compromising investor protection. The policy push reflects a persistent gap in Jamaica’s financing landscape. While micro and small enterprises account for the majority of businesses and a large share of employment, access to affordable capital remains constrained. Bank lending is often out of reach due to collateral requirements, while informal financing and short-term debt can limit growth and strain cash flow. Against that backdrop, the micro market is being positioned as an alternative route — one that allows businesses to raise capital without immediate repayment obligations, while gradually introducing governance, disclosure and transparency standards that can support longer-term growth. Williams pointed to the Junior Market’s track record as evidence that a structured, rules-based framework can broaden participation without undermining confidence. Since its launch, the Junior Market has expanded across multiple sectors and has become a recognised stepping stone for growing companies. “The success of the Junior Market provides strong empirical justification for extending this model downward…the same discipline, governance, transparency and growth pathway that has delivered national benefits over the past 16 years,” she said. Preparatory work is already well under way. A multi-stakeholder steering committee, established in June 2025 and led by the Jamaica Stock Exchange, has been coordinating technical, regulatory and policy work across the public and private sectors. That process, Williams indicated, has reached an advanced stage, with draft rules now being prepared for regulatory review. So far, the committee has identified over 200 prospective micro and small businesses with the possibility of 25 companies listing on the Stock Exchange within two years of the micro market being operational. “I’d like to see the Jamaica Stock Exchange move quickly to drafting micro market rules for integration into the Junior Market rulebook. I’d also like to see submission to the relevant committees and the Financial Services Commission for regulatory consideration,” the finance minister stressed. Capacity-building is expected to form a central part of the rollout, particularly for micro enterprises that may not yet meet traditional listing standards. The intention is to strengthen the pipeline of investment-ready businesses over time, rather than rush companies to market before they are prepared. That emphasis aligns with the broader strategy outlined in Williams’ presentation, which focused on using capital markets to widen access to financing while maintaining fiscal discipline and market integrity. She framed the micro market as one element of a larger effort to mobilise domestic savings — particularly from pension and insurance funds, which collectively manage about $1.2 trillion in assets — into productive, growth-enhancing investments. While stressing the need for strong prudential safeguards, Williams suggested that carefully calibrated adjustments to asset allocation frameworks could unlock additional capital for sectors such as MSMEs and infrastructure, without undermining financial stability. “Our goal is to mobilise long-term domestic savings,",

      "content": "The Alberta Labour Relations Board dismissed an employee complaint alleging that a union had breached its duty of fair representation in failing to file a grievance over long-term disability (“LTD”) benefits. The complainant requested that the union file a grievance with respect to difficulties the complainant was having with the insurer’s administration of his LTD benefits. The union did not initially engage with the complainant and, although it engaged with the complainant later in the process, the union ultimately decided not to file a grievance. The complainant alleged that the employer had not done enough to remedy the significant financial strain caused by the complainant not receiving the LTD benefits to which he claimed to be entitled under the collective agreement, and that the union breached its duty of fair representation for failing to file a grievance. The union asserted that it considered the employer’s obligations under the collective agreement and, pursuant to the collective agreement, the administration of LTD benefits was performed by a third-party insurer and not the employer, and that any grievance was unlikely to be successful. The Board concluded that the complaint lacked merit and summarily dismissed the claim. The Board found no evidence of bad faith, discrimination, or arbitrary conduct. The union had investigated the concerns, considered the terms of the collective agreement, and reasonably concluded that a grievance claim would fail. While the Board noted the lag in communication, it ruled that the delays did not prejudice the complainant’s rights. The complaint was dismissed under section 16(4)(e) of the Labour Relations Code.",

The administrative procedures outline how specific provisions of the Agreement should be applied, including the following:Decision-making and appeals: Clarifies processes for decisions made by pension supervisory authorities and outlines recourse mechanisms available with respect to those decisions.Dispute resolution: Establishes steps for resolving disagreements between pension supervisory authorities with respect to the interpretation of the Agreement.Cooperation, communication, and periodic reporting: Provides guidance on language use, periodic reporting, and notifications to plan administrators when a minor authority exercises a power.Pending matters during authority changes: Addresses issues of continuity when a pension plan’s major authority changes, and provides examples of “pending matters” that might emerge as a result of the change.
Under the Agreement, the major authority generally exercises the functions and powers necessary to apply and enforce the Agreement and makes most initial decisions related to multi-jurisdictional pension plans. Exceptions exist where major and minor authorities agree that the minor authority will make certain decisions, particularly those tied to its own jurisdiction’s legislation.Similar administrative procedures were last issued in May 2011 under the 2011 Agreement Respecting Multi-Jurisdictional Pension Plans.",

      "content": "Canada’s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (“OSFI”) has released the latest edition of its semi-annual newsletter, InfoPensions, providing announcements and reminders on matters relevant to federally regulated pension plans (“FRPPs”).Key updates include:
Late contributions and communications with plan custodians: Under the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 (the “PBSA”), plan administrators must inform their trustee or custodian in writing of all amounts to be remitted to the pension fund through contribution planners. If a payment is not remitted within 30 days after it was due, both the plan administrator and custodian must notify the Superintendent.  OSFI noted that keeping contribution planners current can help avoid non-remittance notices (for example, when there is a material decrease in plan membership resulting in less money being remitted into the pension fund than expected). Basic rate for assessment of pension plans:  The basic rate will remain at $12 for assessments invoiced for plan years ending between October 1, 2025, and September 30, 2026. The basic rate applies to all pension plans registered under the PBSA and the Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act. OSFI Guideline E-23 – Model Risk Management: FRPPs have been excluded from the scope of application of the final guideline published on September 11, 2025. Plan administrators should continue to follow the CAPSA Guideline No. 10 - Risk Management for Plan Administrators.  Further information on Guideline No. 10 can be found . Maximum discount rate: The maximum going concern discount rate of 6.75% remains unchanged for actuarial reports with valuation dates on or after December 31, 2025. Key deadlines for filings and statements: OSFI provided a reminder on regulatory filings and important dates, including that annual filings and plan amendments must be filed using OSFI’s Regulatory Reporting System.
Pension Plans Survey:  As part of OSFI’s ongoing commitment to respond to stakeholder input and continually improve performance, OSFI periodically consults with plan administrators and other stakeholders.  A survey of administrators of large FRPPs (assets of $500 million or more) launched on November 17, 2025, and closed on December 12, 2025. Results will be available in summer 2026.
Search tool for FRPPs: The search tool for FRPPs has moved to the Open Government portal for improved data accessibility.",

(the “Plan”), the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario issued two Notices of Intended Decision (“NOIDs”) to order the wind-up the Plan and impose administrative penalties. The Plan is a single-employer defined contribution pension plan with 13 members.  Despite a previous regulatory order and a warning letter with respect to outstanding contributions, and extensive efforts by FSRA to bring the Plan into compliance, the employer failed to remit contributions for the period from April to August 2025, totaling approximately $9,500. FSRA noted that timely remittance of contributions is a fundamental obligation under the Pension Benefits Act (Ontario) (the “PBA”), and determined that the repeated failure by the employer to make contributions as required by the PBA and the regulations warranted the wind-up of the Plan. FSRA also gave notice that it intends to impose five general administrative penalties on the employer under section 108.2 of the PBA, totaling $19,000. Each penalty of $3,800 corresponds to a failure to remit required contributions for the months of April through August 2025, contrary to section 4(4) of Ontario Regulation 909. 
FSRA cited the following factors in its decision to impose the general administrative penalties:The contraventions were intentional, given prior non-compliance and regulatory warnings.Approximately $9,500 in contributions remain outstanding, causing harm to Plan members who may miss out on investment returns that would otherwise accrue to their defined contribution accounts. The employer failed to take remedial action in relation to its contraventions.
The employer derived economic benefit by withholding employee contributions. Previous contraventions occurred between January 2023 and March 2024, resulting in earlier enforcement actions. The employer has requested a hearing before the Financial Services Tribunal in response to the NOIDs.",

Under the consolidations: Around 1,000 union members, nearly all of whom worked remotely as customer experience agents, should work from the office three times weekly 140 members should move from Barrie, Ontario, to Montreal, Quebec Receiving written notice on July 10, 2024, the members had to indicate their choice between accepting the changes and accepting voluntary severance packages by Aug. 9, 2024. On July 29, 2024, the union brought two policy grievances under the collective agreement to challenge the consolidations, as well as a notice of civil claim requesting an interim injunction to prevent TELUS from requiring the impacted members to indicate their choice by Aug. 9, 2024. According to TELUS, the BC Supreme Court should not grant an injunction because this issue fell within the arbitrator’s exclusive authority. The union countered that the court had inherent authority to fill the remedial gap and avoid irreparable harm until an arbitrator’s appointment. 
On Aug. 8, 2024, a chambers judge of the BC Supreme Court determined that he had the jurisdiction to issue an interim injunction in the circumstances. Applying RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 1994 CanLII 117 (SCC), [1994] 1 SCR 311, he restrained TELUS from requiring the affected members to state their choice by Aug. 9, 2024. The injunction would expire two months after an arbitrator’s appointment, subject to the parties’ written agreement or another court order. TELUS appealed the injunction. Injunction upheld The Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissed the appeal. Although the interim injunction had since expired, the appeal court recognized that the legal questions involved in the proceeding would benefit from appellate consideration. The appeal court accepted that an arbitrator in the federal labour relations context had the statutory authority to issue interim injunctive relief. 
However, the appeal court concluded that the judge correctly found that the BC Supreme Court had the inherent jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction until an appointed arbitrator assumed jurisdiction over the dispute. According to the appeal court, at the time of the injunction application, the BC Supreme Court was the only tribunal that could resolve the matter potentially resulting in irreparable harm to the union’s affected members. 
In reaching this conclusion, the appeal court acknowledged that it was filling a remedial gap and ensuring the availability of a forum to prevent irreparable harm. Next, recognizing the judge’s discretionary exercise, the appeal court refused to interfere with the injunction’s two-month expiry date. 
The appeal court noted that the judge included terms that allowed some flexibility, recognizing that the injunction was an interim remedy, that the appointed arbitrator would have ‘domain’ over injunctive relief, and that TELUS could raise the issue with the arbitrator. Lastly, the appeal court deferred to the judge’s discretionary decision not to require an undertaking regarding damages, given that TELUS showed no material errors of law or principle, or palpable and overriding factual errors.
