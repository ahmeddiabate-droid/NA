      "content": "CRA responsiveness doubled as the 100-Day Service Improvement Plan reaches completion From: Canada Revenue Agency News release Since launching the 100-day Service Improvement Plan earlier this year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has made considerable and marked progress in reducing client wait times, improving service standards, and scaling up new technologies into its processes—all while improving user-friendly services. December 11, 2025 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency Since launching the 100-day Service Improvement Plan earlier this year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has made considerable and marked progress in reducing client wait times, improving service standards, and scaling up new technologies into its processes—all while improving user-friendly services. The 100-Day Service plan was introduced in response to overwhelming service pressures that failed to live up to Canadians’ expectations. It was rooted in four priority areas – improving call response, expanding digital self-service tools, addressing the root causes of service issues, and accelerating service modernization. As the plan concludes, the CRA is reporting meaningful progress across all areas. Call wait times have decreased, digital services are enhanced to make access easier for Canadians, and individuals and businesses receive more efficient support navigating the tax system. On day 101 and beyond, the CRA must continue delivering the level of service Canadians expect and deserve, especially as the upcoming tax-filing season approaches. This is paramount to rebuilding trust in the agency and strengthening service experiences. Renewed efforts to further improve service will draw on these accomplishments and the agency’s forward momentum to drive sustained efficiencies into the new year and beyond. This includes: Better access to phone agents: The number of unique calls answered more than doubled – from 35% to more than 70%, with peaks of 92% – through the extension of term contracts and the rehiring of approximately 1,250 employees to help reduce wait times. A scheduled callback has been implemented for issues related to CRA account access, providing support to more than 59,000 Canadians so far. Easier and more useful digital services: People who lose or forget their CRA sign-in information can now quickly regain access to their account online instead of calling. A new “Manage Balance ” feature lets Canadians make payments or set up payment arrangements in their CRA Account without speaking to an agent. The GenAI chatbot beta can now answer a wider range of questions, including more complex ones for businesses, such as tax credits and compliance information. The document verification service has made CRA account registration quicker, with 88% of new users gaining immediate access in October 2025 , mitigating approximately 300,000 phone calls per year. Updates to Canada.ca/Taxes make it easier to find clear information on benefits, credits, how to open a CRA account, and how long processing will take. Tackling the root causes of service issues: A targeted plan was implemented to reduce wait times for tax adjustments, Disability Tax Credit (DTC) applications, and Canada Child Benefit claims. Reallocating service representatives to these areas resulted in more than 23,000 additional DTC cases being processed, while maintaining the 70% call-answer target. New system enhancement will enable CRA to automatically process roughly 115,000 more tax adjustment requests annually. Accelerating long-term modernization: Phone services were updated so payment-related questions go straight to specialists. This helps Canadians get answers on the first call and avoids about 95,000 transfers each year. Work is being accelerated on a new contact platform that will give Canadians a more modern, consistent service experience by summer 2026. For the complete list of improvements, visit the 100-Day Service Improvement Plan webpage. Looking ahead: Continuous service improvements for tax season As preparations continue for the upcoming tax season, the CRA is building on recent progress to improve clarity, accuracy, and accessibility of services. In the months ahead, the CRA will continue strengthening security measures, streamlining processes to reduce wait times, and expanding the use of digital services—including artificial intelligence and automation—to deliver faster, more responsive service. As tax season approaches, call volumes are expected to rise significantly. Last year, the CRA received more than 32 million calls—peaking at nearly 300,000 a day during filing season. To help manage this surge, term contracts are being extended and additional contact centre staff are being hired, supported by enhanced training focused on accuracy and completeness. Several new services are also being introduced to make interactions with the CRA easier: An updated Progress tracker, that provides individuals, businesses, and their representatives with status updat",

      "content": "CRA strengthens compliance in trucking sector by lifting the moratorium on T4A penalties From: Canada Revenue Agency News release Trucking is vital to connecting Canada’s vast and expansive territory and bridging our united economies. December 4, 2025 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency Trucking is vital to connecting Canada’s vast and expansive territory and bridging our united economies. But tax non-compliance in the trucking sector has allowed some companies to avoid tax obligations, undercutting compliant competitors and denying workers the benefits and pensions they have earned. To restore fairness, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is making changes to improve compliance in the trucking industry. As of today, the CRA has lifted the moratorium on penalties for failing to report fees for services for the 2025 tax year and subsequent tax years. Businesses in this sector will now be assessed penalties if they fail to report payments for services exceeding $500 in a calendar year that are made to a Canadian-controlled private corporation in the trucking industry. These payments must be reported to the CRA in box 048 – fees for services – of the T4A slip by February 28, 2026 . Since this date falls on a Saturday, an information return will be considered on time if the CRA receives it or it is postmarked on or before March 2, 2026 . A business is considered to be operating in the trucking industry if more than 50% of its primary source of income is from trucking activities. These updated reporting requirements will help improve transparency, strengthen compliance, and ensure both payers and workers are meeting their tax obligations, while supporting fair working conditions and safer roads for all Canadians. They build on the strategic investments announced in Budget 2025, which enhance the CRA’s capacity to address non-compliance in the trucking industry. The CRA will publish further guidance in the coming weeks to help businesses determine whether they are affected and understand how to meet their reporting obligations. Quotes “Driver misclassification undermines workers, distorts competition for honest businesses, and puts safety at risk. By lifting the T4A penalties moratorium, we are reinforcing fairness in the trucking industry, ensuring drivers receive the protections they are owed, and contributing to safer roads for all Canadians, while making sure everyone pays their fair share.” The Honourable Francois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Finance and National Revenue ( Tweet this quote. ) “Canada’s supply chains rely on a strong, competitive, and fair trucking industry. Today’s announcement is an important step toward ensuring a level playing field for the thousands of operators who keep our economy moving. By supporting greater transparency and compliance, we are helping to build a trucking sector that continues to be safe, more resilient, and better positioned to serve Canadians and our trading partners.” The Honourable Steven MacKinnon, Minister of Transport and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons ( Tweet this quote. ) “To build the strongest economy in the G7 we need a strong and skilled workforce. Canadians rely on the work of truck drivers every day to get our goods to market and to keep our economy moving. We are focused on ensuring a level playing field for the trucking industry and its drivers.” The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Jobs and Families and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario ( Tweet this quote. ) “By lifting the penalty moratorium on reporting fees for Services (RFS) in the trucking industry, Canada’s new government is cracking down on Driver Inc., closing loopholes, making our roads safer, and standing up for businesses and drivers that play by the rules.” The Honourable Wayne Long, Secretary of State (Canada Revenue Agency and Financial Institutions) ( Tweet this quote. ) Quick facts RFS is the legislated requirement for businesses and organizations to report fees paid to other businesses for services provided. Under the Income Tax Act, payments that exceed $500 in a calendar year must be reported to the CRA in prescribed form, usually the T4A slip. In 2011, the CRA introduced a moratorium on assessing penalties for failing to complete box 048, Fees for services, on the T4A slip. This was meant to allow businesses and organizations time to gain familiarity with the RFS requirement and adopt practices to comply. To restore fairness to the sector and ensure workers are receiving the benefits they deserve, Budget 2025 proposes $77.0 million over four years, starting in 2026-2027 , with ongoing funding of $19.2 million annually, for the CRA to lift the moratorium on the penalties for failure to report fees for service transactions in the trucking industry and to implement a focused program that addresses non-compliance issues related to personal services businesses (PSBs) and RFS.

The fourth edition of the GFIP was hosted by the Canada Revenue Agency in Ottawa, Canada October 24, 2024 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency The Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) welcomed financial institutions, banking associations, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) representatives and other partners at the fourth Global Financial Institutions Partnership (GFIP) Summit to discuss effective practices in combating tax and financial crime. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), in close co-operation with the other J5 members, organized the two-day international summit on public-private co-operation against tax and financial crime in Ottawa, Canada, October 22 and 23, 2024. This international summit gathered more than 100 participants from all five J5 countries— Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. This international summit brought together experts from the public and private sector to discuss the challenges and opportunities in addressing, managing and mitigating current and future tax and financial crime risks. It provided a space for open dialogue and discussion, enhancing our networks through engaging panel discussions and presentations. The summit had a variety of wide-ranging topics of common interest for the GFIP partners involved. It focused on three topics that are at the forefront for GFIP, namely identity theft-based crimes, misuse of financial technology, and trade-based money laundering. The conference’s panel discussions were led by senior representatives from banking institutions, bank associations, FIUs and the five J5 countries. This edition of the GFIP Summit focused on the development of typology papers and other threat-focused projects. “The CRA was honoured to have hosted the 2024 GFIP Summit. Tax and financial crime are constantly evolving and we must adjust and adapt to an everchanging environment,” said Eric Ferron, Canada’s J5 Chief, and Director General of the Criminal Investigations Directorate at the CRA. “The GFIP Summit provides a perfect forum for key senior leaders in the financial and tax sector to address our challenges through public-private partnerships, where we can collaborate to find ways to combat international tax evasion, financial crime, and money laundering.” “The insights and strategies shared at this year's GFIP Summit demonstrated the value in global collaboration and innovation in the face of tax and financial crime. These knowledge-sharing opportunities are crucial to driving impactful change in the global financial ecosystem,” said Jade Hawkins , Acting J5 Chief and Deputy Commissioner at the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). “This year, the J5 has held their fourth GFIP Summit. We were welcomed by our dear colleagues from the CRA who hosted the event in Ottawa, Canada, where we participated in enlightening two-day discussions on key and emerging threats, project development updates and relationship building,” said Niels Obbink, Director General, Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD). “We discussed in depth Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML), specifically in relation to the plastic waste sector. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands have worked with private sector partners and the FIU’s to carry out a detailed analysis of the sector's exposure to potential TBML, creating a method that is potentially replicable across other GFIP stakeholders and J5 partners. The next steps for this work include operationalising that insight to support multi-agency intervention activities. I look forward to the upcoming results from this and other GFIP projects.” “Tax authorities cannot tackle tax crime alone. Businesses have a vital role to play in the fight against those who would undermine our economies and our communities. That’s why the GFIP is so important. The public and private sector working together to identify threats, share knowledge and target those intent on causing harm,” said Richard Las, Director of the Fraud Investigation Service at His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). “I’m delighted at what we’ve achieved during this summit. We’ve strengthened our partnerships and made real progress against key threats, including identity crime and TBML. It’s a shining example of what can be accomplished when we bring our collective skill, expertise and commitment to the table.” “The time investment from every bank attending the GFIP Summit speaks volumes about their desire to work together to combat international tax evasion,” said Guy Ficco, Chief, Internal Revenue Service",

      "content": "J5 publishes first report detailing the alliance’s global impact From: Canada Revenue Agency News release The Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) released its first Report July 24, 2024 detailing the global impact of operations, public-private partnerships, and stakeholder engagement since it’s inception in 2018. July 25, 2024 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency Operational results, training and partnership highlight J5’s first six years WASHINGTON – The Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) released its first Report July 24, 2024 detailing the global impact of operations, public-private partnerships, and stakeholder engagement since it’s inception in 2018. During the J5’s first six years, it has generated more than a hundred leads, seized millions of dollars in criminal proceeds, issued notices to financial institutions and thwarted fraudulent investment and boiler-room schemes. The Report details current statistics from the J5 Cyber Group, noting that the team is currently working more than 30 active cybercrime investigations and that 10 active investigations stemmed from leads produced at the 2023 J5 Cyber Challenge in Ottawa, Canada. The J5 has also provided training to multiple countries across the globe, including South Africa, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Ukraine. It also notes successes of the J5 Professional Enablers Group, including criminal charges against 15 individuals with ties to a boiler-room scheme and tax evasion charges against a United States (U.S.) defense contractor. This group is dedicated to tackling institutions, promoters and service-providers who facilitate and enable tax evasion and money laundering. The J5 considers the launch of the Global Financial Institutions Partnership (GFIP) as one of its biggest achievements. This partnership has engaged more than 20 financial institutions to collaborate on shared priority threats. Representatives from the GFIP convene yearly at a summit to strategize on the best ways to combat financial and tax crimes. “Six years ago, our five countries took a chance and publicly joined together to root out tax crimes,” said Guy Ficco, Chief, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation (CI). “We have learned a tremendous amount by working together and we are now an organization firing on all cylinders with real operational results – results that would not exist were it not for the J5. I’m proud of what we have accomplished together, but I’m also excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead.” “The J5 was bought together for the purpose of tackling tax crime—it’s a global problem and we answered it with a global solution,” said John Ford, Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). “We can’t afford to work in isolation whilst organised criminals and tax cheats manipulate the system and exploit vulnerabilities for their personal gain. Over the past six years, we’ve had some great achievements which wouldn’t have been possible without this network, and I’m confident our successes will continue in the years to come.” “Our outstanding collaboration is one of the main pillars of the J5,” said Eric Ferron, Chief, Canada Revenue Agency’s (CRA) Criminal Investigations Directorate. “This collaboration has only increased over time, and has become ever more important. The J5 members and our partners will once again have the opportunity to showcase their innovative and ambitious work in tackling global tax crime at the upcoming GFIP Summit in the Fall of 2024 in Ottawa, Canada. As the host of this event, I am looking forward to further our work with our public and private sector partners on high priority tax threats.” “Since the launch of the J5 in 2018, we have focused on jointly fighting tax fraud, cyber-focused fraud and money laundering, a playing field we as the Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD) have traditionally been strong in. It is a unique informal international cooperation aimed at combating and preventing cross-border fraud. Unique because of its focus on operational results,” said Niels Obbink, Director General, FIOD. “Some notable results include Operation Atlantis; where signals from the Netherlands and other J5 countries led to a global investigation, Bestmixer; taking the mix service offline, the crypto challenges and the publication of risk indicators linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrency assets. Since its inception, cooperation between countries has gained momentum. This is necessary because criminals are increasingly using borders to their advantage. Full of ambition, we look forward to further intensifying our cooperation.” “From a bold idea to a fully-fledged operational alliance, in just six years the J5 has become the leading force in tackling international tax crime,” said Richard Las, Director, Fraud Investigation Service, His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). “We know that criminals don't recognise or respect our borders.

      "content": "The CRA invites taxpayers to share ideas for service improvements From: Canada Revenue Agency News release The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is committed to providing a high-quality service experience for taxpayers and benefit recipients. September 25, 2024 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is committed to providing a high-quality service experience for taxpayers and benefit recipients. To deliver on these efforts, the CRA is launching public consultations to hear from individuals, non-professional representatives, and tax intermediaries about their experiences with CRA services. The CRA service consultations 2024 will play an important role in further understanding the experiences of those who rely on CRA services, and identifying areas where improvements are needed. As the CRA adapts to an ever-changing environment, ensuring our services remain accessible, responsive, and tailored to the evolving needs of clients is our top priority. How to participate From September 25 to December 2, 2024 , individuals, non-professional representatives, and tax intermediaries have the opportunity to share feedback on their experiences interacting with CRA services through an online questionnaire. The CRA will also hold both in-person and virtual consultation sessions with members of these groups by invitation, allowing for more in-depth discussions. Every voice matters : participate in the online questionnaire to share your feedback and help shape the future of CRA services. To ensure the privacy of participants and that a wide range of perspectives is captured, the recruitment of participants and reporting will be managed by an independent third party. What we hope to learn As the world changes with new technologies and evolving trends, your expectations of government services are also shifting. The CRA is the administrator of a complex tax system and recognizes the need to be responsive to these changes to deliver services that strive to put people first. We know taxpayers and benefit recipients deserve a better service experience and we want to focus on what matters most to them. This is why we need feedback. Through these consultations, we aim to understand the specific challenges they are facing and identify areas where our services fall short of their expectations. How feedback shapes improvements Over the past few years, there has been a growing demand for digital-first, seamless experiences, prompting the CRA to modernize its services to enhance ease of access. Previous feedback has been pivotal in driving service improvements, and these consultations are another important step in ensuring our services address the needs of our clients. Recent key improvements include: Introducing a digital application for the Disability Tax Credit to streamline the process for those who rely on this essential support. Enhancing the CRA’s sign-in services to ensure faster and more secure access to online accounts. Implementing the Learn about your taxes online learning tool to help young people better understand and manage their tax obligations. Increasing Contact Centre hours to improve access to timely support, recognizing the challenges individuals and businesses face in reaching us, we are working to ensure they can get the help they need when they need it. Expanding the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) , which helps vulnerable and lower-income populations access free tax-filing support. While we’ve made progress, the CRA recognizes that challenges remain and there is still more work to be done. Encouraging participation in these consultations will play a key role in shaping the future of CRA programs and services, making it easier for taxpayers to understand their tax obligations and receive the benefits and credits they may be eligible for.

      "content": "News If You Do Business in New Brunswick, It’s Time to Report Unclaimed Property SAINT JOHN – The annual reporting period under New Brunswick’s Unclaimed Property Act is now open. Businesses and organizations holding unclaimed funds have until March 31, 2026, to report these funds to New Brunswick’s Unclaimed Property (UP) Program at FundsFinderNB.ca . Administered by the Financial and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick (The Commission), the program is now in its fourth year. “At the end of last year’s reporting period, 333 unique businesses had reported more than $41.1 million in unclaimed property since the program’s launch,” said Marissa Sollows, the Commission’s Director of Communications and Public Affairs. “These are funds that can now be reunited with their rightful owners.” Unclaimed property refers to money and other monetary property held by businesses and other entities that has been forgotten or abandoned by its owners. Uncashed cheques, security deposits and customer overpayments are common examples of unclaimed property that holders might possess. “Since launching the FundsFinderNB.ca website, we’ve reunited New Brunswickers with $3.3 million in forgotten funds,” Sollows said. “To continue this success, we rely on businesses to report any unclaimed property on their books. Every year, more money becomes unclaimed, and it’s vital that businesses understand their responsibilities under the law.” To support businesses, the Commission has launched awareness campaigns and provided resources at FundsFinderNB.ca , including step-by-step guides, FAQs and templates to help organizations comply with their reporting obligations. Money and monetary property are generally considered unclaimed when there has been no activity for at least three years, or 10 years for credit union accounts. If the apparent owner does not respond to contact efforts from the business, the property must then be reported to the Unclaimed Property Program.

      "content": "Alerts Fraud alert: Fake “Carleton Credit Union” scam targeting investors The Financial and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick is warning New Brunswickers about a scam using phony websites for a fake credit union in Centreville, NB. Scammers are cold calling people claiming to represent the “Carleton Credit Union,” which they allege is based in Centreville, NB and are soliciting investments. No such credit union is registered with the Commission and an entity using that business name is not registered to deal or advise in securities or derivatives in New Brunswick. During the calls, the scammers point to fake websites designed to lend legitimacy to their investment offers. Three websites have been discovered to date using variations of the fake credit union name: carletoncn.com carltoncreunion.com carltonpioneercru.ca All three list the address of the “Carleton Credit Union” at 3143 Main St., Centreville, NB – this is the actual address of the Brunswick Credit Union, a legitimate registered credit union in New Brunswick. The Commission has notified the Brunswick Credit Union of the scam. How to protect yourself Never provide personal, credit card or banking details in response to unsolicited phone calls or messages, and do not enter those details on any website if you are not certain the site is genuine. Before making any investment, give yourself permission to pause and ensure the person or entity is licensed or registered with the Commission. It does not matter if the person or entity is based in the province or not. If they do business in New Brunswick, they must be licensed or registered with the Commission. This applies whether the business is done in person, in writing, online or over the phone. For credit unions operating in New Brunswick, the Commission provides corporate registry services. A list of incorporated credit unions in New Brunswick can be found here . To check if an individual or firm is registered to deal or advise in securities or derivatives in New Brunswick, use the National Registration Search tool. Don’t rush a decision or be pressured to invest your money. Seek the advice of a registered financial professional. Anyone who suspects they may have been a victim of this fraud should report it to the Commission by calling 1-866-933-2222, emailing info@fcnb.ca , or online by visiting fcnb.ca .",

      "content": "News New Brunswick moves forward with title protection legislation SAINT JOHN – New Brunswick has taken an important step in protecting the titles “financial advisor” and “financial planner.” On January 1, the Financial Advisor and Financial Planner Title Protection Act ( Act ) came into force. The aim of the legislation is to increase consumer and investor protection by providing New Brunswickers with clarity and confidence when working with individuals using those or similar titles. “Under the Act, professionals who use these titles will have to meet minimum education standards and be overseen by a credentialing body approved by the Commission,” said Marissa Sollows, the director of Communication and Public Affairs for the Commission. “Until now, the titles “financial advisor” and “financial planner” were unregulated in the province.” The Financial and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick will be the regulatory body for the title protection regime in New Brunswick. It will approve and oversee credentialing bodies and will approve the credentials required to use the two regulated titles. To help the industry and their clients adapt to the new title protection legislation, the framework is being phased in over time. The transition periods – two years for financial advisors and four years for financial planners – will give individuals time to comply. These periods apply to individuals using these titles without an approved credential on or before January 1, 2026. The title protection regime is voluntary. Professionals will be able to choose whether to obtain an approved credential, which will allow them to use one of the protected (or similar) titles, or choose not to use one of the protected titles. “For those who choose to participate, they can have confidence knowing that New Brunswick’s title protection legislation is promoting consistency, professionalism and credibility among their colleagues and New Brunswickers,” Sollows said. Background Concerned about the wide array of titles used by individuals in New Brunswick’s financial marketplace, the New Brunswick government mandated the Commission in 2021 to develop a title protection regime for the province. Following a public consultation with industry stakeholders and consumer and investor advocates in August 2021, the Commission proposed legislation to the province in May 2022. The Act received Royal Assent on June 16, 2023, and two proposed rules to support the title protection framework were published in January 2024 for a 90-day comment period. The two rules were approved by the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board on November 7, 2025 and the Act was proclaimed on January 1, 2026. Media Contact: 1 866 933-2222 or media@fcnb.ca .

      "content": "Regulatory Updates Canadian securities regulators’ new capability disarms more than 3,900 fraudulent investment websites TORONTO - The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) in collaboration with the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) today announced initial results from its newly launched initiative to help combat the rising number of fraudulent websites that pose a threat to Canadian investors. Between June 5, 2025, and November 23, 2025, regulators worked to successfully deactivate more than 3,900 fake investment platforms and cryptocurrency scam websites involving more than 6,900 individual URLs associated with those sites. “Aided by advancements in technology, the number of scam investment websites has grown significantly in recent years and this initiative is part of the CSA’s broader strategy to combat online financial fraud and enhance investor protection in the digital age,” said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. “Proactive investor protection is a cornerstone of our mandate, and this innovative solution supports our efforts to better protect Canadians from investment fraud.” “The success of this initial phase shows that this technology can make a real difference, and the results show the impact it is already having,” said Grant Vingoe, Chair of the CSA’s Policy Coordination Committee and CEO of the Ontario Securities Commission, which led the procurement and testing of the capability on behalf of the CSA and CIRO. “By identifying fraudulent websites quickly, we are taking meaningful steps to safeguard Canadians’ financial futures.” While the new initiative results in the rapid deactivation of many problematic websites, Canadians are encouraged to report any websites they have concerns about to their local securities regulator. The CSA continues to urge investors to remain vigilant and to look out for common red flags of investment fraud, including: The involvement of unregistered individuals or firms. Promises of high or guaranteed returns on low-risk investments. Unsolicited advice or requests to access your devices from strangers. Feeling pressured into making a decision on the spot. Fake endorsement involving a celebrity, athlete or politician on social media. Requests for money when attempting to withdraw funds. Fraud recovery companies that promise to get back lost funds. Investors are reminded that investment firms need to register with provincial or territorial securities regulators as dealers or advisers to open trading accounts or recommend investments. Investors should always check the registration of anyone who tries to sell them an investment or give them investment advice with the CSA’s National Registration Search . Further resources on how to identify and avoid fraud can be found on the CSA’s website . Suspect you or someone you know is a victim of an investment scam? If you feel like you or someone you know has been approached or is a victim of fraudulent investment, contact your local securities regulator .

      "date": "2026-01-13",
      "content": "Speed cameras are now in use in select areas of the province to detect vehicles travelling above the posted speed limit. Full rollout of the Speed Camera Program will occur in stages, the first of which is the installation of 10 cameras on provincial and municipal roads and highways. As the program expands, more speed cameras will be installed on our roads and highways, and also in construction and school zones, at traffic-light controlled intersections and on the stop arms of school buses. Speed cameras help keep Newfoundland and Labrador’s roads safe by taking pictures of a vehicle’s licence plate when it goes over the posted speed limit. Speed cameras are placed in areas of high traffic where speeding is a problem, including school zones and residential neighbourhoods. The purpose of using speed cameras is to promote road safety and safe driving practices, which helps prevent collisions, injuries and deaths. Where are speed cameras located? Speed cameras are placed in areas where safety is a concern, such as: Areas with a history of speeding violations Areas with a history of high-speed collisions causing injury and/or death Areas with high pedestrian activity, especially children Areas near schools, playgrounds, and residential neighborhoods Areas where speed cameras are in use: Veteran’s Memorial Highway, Avalon Peninsula.

GPS Coordinates: 47.528923, -52.783128 Certificate of Accuracy – Camera 0103 Note: The above list will be updated as more cameras are put in use. How does a speed camera work? Detecting Speed As vehicles pass a speed camera, the speed at which the vehicle is travelling is detected by the camera. Taking a Picture If a vehicle is speeding, the camera takes a picture of the rear license plate and records the following information: the date and time the image was captured the location of the speed camera the speed the vehicle was travelling stated in kilometres per hour the posted speed limit the direction of travel of the vehicle Reviewing the Picture Traffic compliance officers review each picture to confirm the vehicle was speeding. Sending a Ticket A ticket is mailed to the registered owner, even if they were not the driver at the time of the speeding violation. It includes details about the speeding offence, pictures of the vehicle and license plate, and how to pay or contest the ticket. Why use speed cameras? Speeding is a leading cause of collisions, injuries and deaths on the province’s roads. Speed cameras are proven to reduce average vehicle speed in areas where they are installed. Drivers tend to slow down when they know a camera is present. Numerous studies have shown that speed cameras contribute to fewer accidents. Lower speed reduces the likelihood and severity of crashes. Speed cameras allow for consistent, unbiased enforcement without needing a police officer to be present. This frees up law enforcement for other priorities. Speed cameras: Help slow down traffic Prevent serious road collisions Make roads safer for everyone, especially pedestrians, cyclists, and children Encourage drivers to develop safer road habits over time Frequently Asked Questions What are speed cameras? Speed cameras are devices that use radar and cameras to automatically take pictures of vehicles going over the posted speed limit. If a vehicle is speeding, the camera takes a picture of the license plate. A ticket is then sent to the registered owner of the vehicle, even if they were not the one driving. Where can speed cameras be used? Speed cameras can be used on any highway or road in Newfoundland and Labrador. Why not just use police? Speed cameras work with police, not instead of them. While the police handle many types of traffic enforcement, speed cameras help by constantly watching how fast vehicles are going in particular areas. How will speed cameras prevent collisions, injuries and deaths? By enforcing posted speed limits, speed cameras promote road safety and safe driving practices. Speed cameras help slow down traffic and encourage drivers to develop safer habits over time. Are speed cameras effective? National and international jurisdictions have reported success in reducing and preventing collisions, injuries and deaths on their roads. Studies have also shown that the use of speed cameras reduce and prevent both the number and severity of collisions. How does the province choose where to place a speed camera? Locations are chosen based on available traffic data, and in consultation with municipalities and law enforcement. Will",
